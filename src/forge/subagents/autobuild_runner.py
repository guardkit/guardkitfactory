"""Async autobuild runner subagent (TASK-FW10-002, FEAT-FORGE-010).

This module is the production implementation of the long-running
autobuild stage. The supervisor dispatches it via
DeepAgents ``start_async_task`` (per ADR-ARCH-031); the compiled
:data:`graph` exported here is the addressable surface the
``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` looks up by ``graph_id="autobuild_runner"``
when ``langgraph.json`` resolves the ``autobuild_runner`` entry.

DDR-006 + DDR-007 — single transition site
==========================================

DDR-006 defines the ``async_tasks`` state-channel entry shape
(:class:`AutobuildState`) and mandates that every lifecycle transition
flow through one ``_update_state(...)`` helper. DDR-007 places the
``PipelineLifecycleEmitter`` call at the **same** boundary:

.. code-block:: text

    state-channel write   ─┐
                           ├── inside _update_state(), one function call
    emitter.on_transition ─┘

If a transition writes the channel but skips the emit (or vice versa),
operators see inconsistent live progress — that is a test failure (see
``tests/forge/test_autobuild_runner.py``).

Lifecycle progression (per DDR-006 ``Literal``):

.. code-block:: text

    starting → planning_waves → running_wave → awaiting_approval
              → pushing_pr → completed | cancelled | failed

ASSUM-018 — stage-complete envelope shape
=========================================

When the runner emits ``stage_complete`` from inside the subagent, the
envelope's ``target_kind`` is ``"subagent"`` and ``target_identifier``
is the runner's own ``task_id`` (the value returned by
``start_async_task``). The supervisor's emits for stages dispatched
*outside* the subagent retain the existing taxonomy.

Worktree confinement (Group E security scenario)
================================================

Filesystem writes performed by the subagent must fall under the
build's worktree allowlist. :func:`assert_within_worktree` resolves
the candidate path and rejects anything escaping the supplied root
(symlink-aware via :meth:`Path.resolve`).

Failure-mode contract (ADR-ARCH-008, DDR-007 §Failure-mode contract)
====================================================================

If the emitter call raises (NATS publish failure, broker outage, etc.)
the runner logs at ``WARNING`` and continues. SQLite remains the
authoritative source of truth; the build is not regressed by a
transient publish hiccup.

Forward compatibility
=====================

The subagent receives the emitter as an in-process Python object via
the ``start_async_task`` context payload (DDR-007 Option A). This
relies on DeepAgents ``0.5.3`` accepting non-serialisable context
under ASGI co-deployment (per ADR-ARCH-031). The smoke test in
``tests/forge/test_autobuild_runner.py`` exercises this contract; if
DeepAgents rejects the in-process emitter, the test is the canary —
the F3 risk on FEAT-FORGE-010 is that a runtime upgrade silently
flips this contract.

You are the **autobuild_runner** AsyncSubAgent.

You are launched by the supervisor's ``start_async_task`` and execute the
long-running autobuild for one feature plan. Drive the lifecycle through
the DDR-006 transitions:

    starting → planning_waves → running_wave → awaiting_approval
              → pushing_pr → completed | cancelled | failed

On every lifecycle change the runtime calls ``_update_state`` which
writes the ``async_tasks`` state channel AND emits to the
``PipelineLifecycleEmitter`` at the same boundary (DDR-006 + DDR-007).
A transition that writes the channel without emitting (or vice versa)
is a contract violation.

Confine all filesystem writes to the build's worktree allowlist
(``forward_context.worktree_path``). Reject paths that escape the
allowlist (Group E security scenario).

When you emit ``stage_complete`` from inside this subagent, set
``target_kind="subagent"`` and ``target_identifier`` to your own
``task_id`` (ASSUM-018).

If the emitter raises (NATS publish failure, broker outage), log at
WARNING and continue — SQLite remains authoritative (ADR-ARCH-008,
DDR-007 §Failure-mode contract).
