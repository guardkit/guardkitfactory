"""TASK-CGCP-010: ``gate_check`` coordinator + state-machine integration.

This module is the **only** place in ``forge.gating`` that knows how to
compose the full gating sequence at every gated stage:

1. Read priors from Graphiti (``forge_pipeline_history``,
   ``forge_calibration_history``).
2. Read calibration adjustments — **always with**
   ``approved_only=True`` (closes risk **R8**, F9 / Group C
   ``@negative``).
3. Call :func:`forge.gating.evaluate_gate` (pure-domain).
4. Persist the resulting :class:`~forge.gating.models.GateDecision` to
   SQLite **first**, and to Graphiti's
   ``forge_pipeline_history`` group second. SQLite is the source of
   truth (F10 / Group E ``@data-integrity``); a Graphiti write or NATS
   publish failure is an operational signal, not a roll-back trigger.
5. Branch on :class:`~forge.gating.models.GateMode`:

   * ``AUTO_APPROVE`` — return immediately, the wrapper has no
     state-machine work to do.
   * ``HARD_STOP`` — transition the build to ``FAILED`` via the
     injected state machine.
   * ``FLAG_FOR_REVIEW`` / ``MANDATORY_HUMAN_APPROVAL`` — atomically:
     persist the ``request_id`` against the paused-build row,
     transition to ``PAUSED``, and publish the
     :class:`~nats_core.events.ApprovalRequestPayload` (closes risk
     **R7**, F5 / Group E ``@concurrency @data-integrity``).
     Then await Rich's response via the subscriber, rehydrate via
     :func:`forge.adapters.langgraph.resume_value_as` (closes risk
     **R2**), and dispatch on the response decision.

This module **also** owns:

* :func:`recover_paused_builds` — the boot-time hook that re-emits
  :class:`ApprovalRequestPayload` for every paused build using the
  **persisted** ``request_id`` (closes risk **R5**, Group D
  ``@regression``).
* :func:`cli_cancel_build` / :func:`cli_skip_stage` — CLI bridges that
  delegate to :class:`~forge.adapters.nats.SyntheticResponseInjector`
  (TASK-CGCP-008) so the CLI steering paths flow through the standard
  subscriber dedup gate (closes risk **F6**).

Architecture
------------

Domain core (this module) only depends on:

* The pure-domain :mod:`forge.gating` models / pure ``evaluate_gate``.
* Adapter Protocol surfaces declared inline below — every adapter is
  injected by the application boundary, not imported. The two concrete
  helpers reachable from this module
  (:func:`forge.adapters.langgraph.resume_value_as` and the
  :class:`SyntheticResponseInjector` instance the CLI bridge calls) are
  duck-typed via the same Protocol surfaces.

This keeps ``forge.gating.wrappers`` testable with simple in-memory
fakes — no NATS broker, no SQLite file, no Graphiti instance is
required. TASK-CGCP-011 covers full integration over a real NATS +
SQLite stack.

Pause-and-publish atomicity (F5)
--------------------------------

The contract is *not* a distributed transaction; it is **ordering
inside a single async function with no awaits between the SQLite
commit and the publish call** so an external observer can never see
``status=PAUSED`` without a corresponding bus publish having been
issued. The implementation in :func:`_atomic_pause_and_publish`
documents and enforces that ordering.

The publish itself may still fail — that surfaces as
:class:`ApprovalPublishError` from the publisher and propagates up to
the caller — but the SQLite row is **not** rolled back. The boot-time
hook :func:`recover_paused_builds` is what closes the loop on a
crashed publish: the build re-emits its approval request on restart
using the persisted ``request_id``.
