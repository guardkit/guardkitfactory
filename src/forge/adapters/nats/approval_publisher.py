"""Outbound publisher for Forge approval-request envelopes (TASK-CGCP-006).

Owns the wire-side of the protocol described in
``docs/design/contracts/API-nats-approval-protocol.md`` §2–§3:

- Resolves the canonical subject ``agents.approval.forge.{build_id}`` from
  :data:`nats_core.topics.Topics.Agents.APPROVAL_REQUEST`, optionally
  scoped via :meth:`Topics.for_project` for multi-tenant deployments.
- Serialises a :class:`nats_core.envelope.MessageEnvelope` to bytes and
  hands it to the underlying async NATS client.
- Wraps any transport-level error in :class:`ApprovalPublishError` so
  callers can catch a single typed exception — failure does NOT swallow
  silently and does NOT cause the publisher to mutate any caller-side
  state (the SQLite mirror in TASK-CGCP-010 is recorded *before* the
  publish call; failure here surfaces but never rolls that mirror back).

This module is the **single source of truth** for the eleven-key
``details`` dict shape per §3.2 (AC-008): no other module in
``forge.gating`` or ``forge.adapters.nats.approval_*`` should construct
that dict directly. Callers must invoke :func:`_build_approval_details`
to obtain a structurally-conformant value.

Design parity:

- The transport pattern mirrors ``forge.adapters.nats.pipeline_publisher``
  (TASK-NFI-006): build envelope → ``model_dump_json`` → ``self._nc.publish``.
- The exception shape mirrors :class:`PublishFailure` from the same
  module so downstream log scrapers parse one consistent format.
- The risk-level table is taken **verbatim** from
  ``API-nats-approval-protocol §3.3`` and exported as :func:`_derive_risk_level`
  for direct unit-test coverage.

    The keys are emitted in the order documented in the protocol so the

    The ``decision``-derived fields are read directly from the

            Threaded so notification adapters can render the feature label

        artefact_paths: Filesystem paths the reviewer should inspect.
            Copied defensively so caller mutations after publish do not
