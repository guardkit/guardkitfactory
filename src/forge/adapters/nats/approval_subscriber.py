"""Inbound approval subscriber with short-TTL dedup buffer (TASK-CGCP-007).

This module owns Forge's inbound subscription on the ``.response`` mirror
subject for an approval-paused build per
``API-nats-approval-protocol.md §5`` and the **idempotency contract** per
§6 (ASSUM-006 high). It is the consumer-side counterpart to:

* TASK-CGCP-006 — :class:`ApprovalPublisher` (outbound request publish).
* TASK-CGCP-008 — :class:`SyntheticResponseInjector` (CLI cancel/skip).

Responsibilities (mirrors the AC list of TASK-CGCP-007):

* Subscribe to ``agents.approval.forge.{build_id}.response``
  (project-scoped via :meth:`nats_core.topics.Topics.for_project` if a
  project is configured).
* Validate every inbound :class:`MessageEnvelope` and inner
  :class:`ApprovalResponsePayload`.
* Maintain a **per-subscriber-instance, short-TTL dedup set** keyed on
  the literal ``request_id`` echoed back by the responder — never
  re-derive (the responder's echoed value is the wire contract).
* First-response-wins: subsequent responses with the same ``request_id``
  are observed but discarded so the caller's wait loop does not resume
  the build twice (closes risk **R4** — concurrent-response race).
* Refuse responses whose ``decision`` is outside the schema's allowed
  ``Literal["approve", "reject", "defer", "override"]`` (Group C
  ``@negative``); the rejection is logged but pause is *not* cancelled
  so a correctly-formed response can still be sent.
* Refuse responses whose ``decided_by`` (design-name ``responder``) is
  not the deployment's configured expected approver (Group E
  ``@security``); the build keeps waiting.
* Refresh-on-timeout per ``API §7``: when ``default_wait_seconds``
  elapses without a response, increment ``attempt_count`` and publish a
  fresh :class:`ApprovalRequestPayload` via the injected
  :data:`PublishRefreshCallback`. The prior ``request_id`` remains
  valid for dedup until the short TTL elapses.
* Total wait bounded by :attr:`ApprovalConfig.max_wait_seconds`.

Clock injection is mandatory — the dedup TTL never reads the wall clock
directly. Tests substitute :class:`Clock` instances that advance time
deterministically.
