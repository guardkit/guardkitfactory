"""NATS adapter — specialist dispatch (bind / publish / deliver).

Thin transport adapter binding the pure-domain
:class:`forge.dispatch.correlation.CorrelationRegistry` (TASK-SAD-003) and
:class:`forge.dispatch.orchestrator.DispatchOrchestrator` (TASK-SAD-006) to
JetStream. This is the **only** module in FEAT-FORGE-003's dispatch layer
that is allowed to import :mod:`nats.aio` types — the orchestrator,
registry, parser, retry coordinator, and outcome helpers must remain
free of NATS imports.

Subject layout
--------------

================================  ==================================================
Direction                         Subject
================================  ==================================================
Forge → specialist (command)      ``agents.command.{matched_agent_id}``
specialist → Forge (reply)        ``agents.result.{matched_agent_id}.{correlation_key}``
================================  ==================================================

The singular ``agents.command`` / ``agents.result`` convention is the
fleet-wide adoption (DRD-001..004; FEAT-FORGE-002 ADR adoption recorded
in Graphiti ``architecture_decisions``). The per-correlation suffix on the
reply subject means each dispatch attempt owns its own subscription —
exactly-once and source-authenticity invariants are clean to enforce in
:class:`CorrelationRegistry` without router-side fan-out.

Headers on the dispatch command
-------------------------------

* ``correlation_key`` — 32 lowercase hex (per the
  :data:`forge.dispatch.correlation.CORRELATION_KEY_RE` contract).
* ``requesting_agent_id`` — fixed string ``"forge"``.
* ``dispatched_at`` — ISO 8601 UTC timestamp at publish time.

Reply correlation lifecycle
---------------------------

* :meth:`NatsSpecialistDispatchAdapter.subscribe_reply` is called from
  :meth:`CorrelationRegistry.bind` (via the wiring established in
  TASK-SAD-011). It returns ONLY after the underlying NATS subscription
  is fully established — i.e. the SUB protocol command has been flushed
  to the server. The orchestrator's subscribe-before-publish invariant
  depends on this contract.
* :meth:`unsubscribe_reply` is called from
  :meth:`CorrelationRegistry.release`. It is idempotent — calling it a
  second time with the same correlation key is a no-op.
* :meth:`_on_reply_received` is the per-message callback registered
  with the NATS subscription. It extracts ``source_agent_id`` from the
  message headers, decodes the JSON payload, and forwards to
  :meth:`CorrelationRegistry.deliver_reply`. Authentication is enforced
  in the registry, **not** here — the adapter simply forwards what it
  observed.

PubAck semantics
----------------

JetStream's PubAck (when the audit stream is configured to emit one) is
treated as a "publish was sent" signal only — it is logged at DEBUG and
**never** routed through :meth:`CorrelationRegistry.deliver_reply`. The
binding's outcome is determined by the actual reply payload landing on
the per-correlation reply subscription. This mirrors the LES1 parity
rule already enforced in :class:`forge.adapters.nats.PipelinePublisher`.

References
----------

* TASK-SAD-010 — this task.
* TASK-SAD-003 — :class:`CorrelationRegistry` + ``CorrelationKey``.
* TASK-SAD-006 — :class:`DispatchOrchestrator`.
* TASK-SAD-011 — wiring + ``FakeNatsClient`` recording extension.

    Wires the pure-domain :class:`CorrelationRegistry` and the dispatch

    * The injected NATS client (must support ``subscribe(subject, cb=...)``
      and ``publish(subject, payload, headers=...)``). The connection is
      created by FEAT-FORGE-002's bootstrap code; we do **not** open a

    * The injected :class:`CorrelationRegistry` — its
      :meth:`~CorrelationRegistry.deliver_reply` is the sink that
      :meth:`_on_reply_received` forwards to.
    * A per-correlation subscription handle map so

        nats_client: An async NATS client with ``subscribe`` / ``publish``

        registry: The :class:`CorrelationRegistry` whose
            ``deliver_reply`` this adapter forwards inbound replies to.
        clock: A :class:`forge.discovery.protocol.Clock` providing the
            UTC timestamp stamped onto the ``dispatched_at`` header.
            Defaults to a :class:`SystemClock` so production callers do
            not have to wire one explicitly; tests inject a deterministic
            fake to make the header value predictable. Routing time
