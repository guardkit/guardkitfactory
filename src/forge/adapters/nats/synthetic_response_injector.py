"""Synthetic ``ApprovalResponsePayload`` injector for forge cancel/skip.

Implements the CLI steering paths for a paused build per
``API-nats-approval-protocol.md §7`` (timeout-and-steering table) and
ASSUM-005 (high). When Rich runs ``forge cancel FEAT-XXX`` or
``forge skip FEAT-XXX`` against a paused build the system needs to
resume the LangGraph ``interrupt()`` waiting on the approval response
mirror subject. Rather than open a parallel resume code path that
silently bypasses the dedup gate (closes risk **F6**), this module
**publishes a typed synthetic** :class:`~nats_core.events.ApprovalResponsePayload`
onto the **same** ``agents.approval.forge.{build_id}.response`` subject
that real Rich responses traverse so the standard subscriber
(TASK-CGCP-007) consumes it through its **first-response-wins**
idempotency gate.

Mappings (ASSUM-005 high; API §7 table):

==========================  ========================================================
CLI command                 Synthetic ``ApprovalResponsePayload``
==========================  ========================================================
``forge cancel FEAT-XXX``   ``decision="reject"``,
                            ``decided_by="rich"``, ``notes="cli cancel"``
``forge skip FEAT-XXX``     ``decision="override"``,
                            ``decided_by="rich"``, ``notes="cli skip"``
==========================  ========================================================

The ``ApprovalResponsePayload`` schema (``nats_core.events._agent``)
declares the responder identity as ``decided_by`` and the human-readable
explanation as ``notes``. The design contract in
``API-nats-approval-protocol.md §4.1`` refers to these same fields by the
ergonomic names ``responder`` and ``reason`` — this module bridges the
two name spaces by populating ``decided_by`` from the design ``responder``
slot and ``notes`` from the design ``reason`` slot. A subscriber that
reads the payload via the ``nats_core`` model will see ``decided_by``
and ``notes``; a subscriber that reads the persisted record via the
gating-layer mirror sees the design-level ``responder``/``reason`` keys.

Idempotency contract
--------------------

Per ``API §6``, responders deduplicate on ``request_id`` with
first-response-wins semantics. The synthetic injector keys on the
**same** deterministic ``request_id`` derived by
:func:`forge.gating.identity.derive_request_id` — guaranteeing that:

* a synthetic CLI cancel/skip arriving **before** any real Rich response
  resumes the build with reason ``"cli cancel"`` / ``"cli skip"``, and
* a synthetic CLI cancel/skip arriving **after** a real Rich response
  has already resumed the build is observed by the dedup buffer and
  silently discarded (no double-resume).

The ``attempt_count`` passed to :meth:`SyntheticResponseInjector.inject_cli_cancel`
and :meth:`SyntheticResponseInjector.inject_cli_skip` MUST be the value
**persisted in SQLite** at first emission for the paused stage, not a
freshly-derived live value. This prevents drift if the timeout-refresh
loop (TASK-CGCP-007) has advanced the persisted ``attempt_count`` since
the inject call was issued.
