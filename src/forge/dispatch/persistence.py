"""Persistence layer for dispatch resolutions + sensitive-parameter scrub.

Implements the durable write path for
:class:`~forge.discovery.models.CapabilityResolution` records into a
SQLite-backed history store. The persistence boundary is also the
sensitive-parameter scrub boundary: callers pass a list of
:class:`DispatchParameter` records, and any parameter flagged
``sensitive=True`` has its ``value`` dropped before any row is written.

This design enforces the **schema-driven** scrub by construction —
sensitive values cannot leak into the database because there is no
write path for them. The non-sensitive *names* of sensitive parameters
are still recorded so the audit trail shows that dispatch carried
sensitive data, without revealing the values themselves.

Implements scenarios E.sensitive-parameter-hygiene and the
write-before-send invariant of D.write-before-send-invariant
(TASK-SAD-002).

Composition not editing
-----------------------
The persistence module deliberately writes to *sibling* tables —
``forge_capability_resolutions`` and ``forge_dispatch_parameters`` —
so FEAT-FORGE-001's existing schema is left untouched. The two
tables join the FEAT-FORGE-001 history via the resolution's
``build_id`` (correlation_id-equivalent) without taking a hard
foreign-key dependency on rows owned by another feature.
