"""Boot-time crash-recovery reconciliation (TASK-PSM-007).

On agent-runtime startup the pipeline must reconcile every build that
the previous process left in a non-terminal state. The previous process
may have crashed mid-transition; without a deterministic reconciliation
pass, builds would silently stall — RUNNING rows would never advance,
PAUSED rows would never re-issue their approval request, and
FINALISING rows could leave a half-published PR record.

This module is the **single boot-time entry point** for that pass:

* :func:`reconcile_on_boot` is called exactly once from the agent
  runtime startup hook.
* The per-state action matrix is taken verbatim from
  ``docs/design/contracts/API-sqlite-schema.md §6``.
* Every state transition flows through
  :func:`forge.lifecycle.state_machine.transition` →
  :meth:`SqliteLifecyclePersistence.apply_transition` (concern
  ``sc_001``). This module never issues raw ``UPDATE`` against the
  ``builds.status`` column; the seam test
  ``test_recovery_uses_state_machine_transitions`` static-greps for that.
* PAUSED-recovery re-publishes the original
  ``ApprovalRequestPayload.request_id`` **verbatim** (concern
  ``sc_004``). A fresh UUID would orphan any approval response that the
  human reviewer (or Rich/Jarvis) had already posted before the crash —
  the responder correlates by ``request_id``.

+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

|              | ``forge history``                                   |

+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Idempotency
-----------

Running :func:`reconcile_on_boot` twice in a row produces no additional
state changes (Group D crash-recovery scenarios):

* QUEUED stays QUEUED, INTERRUPTED stays INTERRUPTED — both no-ops.
* PREPARING / RUNNING / FINALISING become INTERRUPTED on the first run;
  on the second run they are INTERRUPTED, which is a no-op.
* PAUSED stays PAUSED on both runs (PAUSED → PAUSED is *not* a
  transition; the re-publish is a wire-level action, not a state
  change). The second run re-publishes the approval request with the
  same ``request_id``; downstream responders dedupe by ``request_id``,
  so a duplicate publish is harmless.

Failure isolation
-----------------

Recovery never aborts on a single per-build failure. Each build is
reconciled inside its own ``try``/``except``; failures are recorded on
:attr:`RecoveryReport.failures` so the operator sees them in the boot
log, but other builds are still reconciled. This avoids the
"one wedged build blocks the entire pipeline restart" failure mode.

    The report is the operator's audit trail for what the boot-time
    reconciliation did. It is intentionally a plain dataclass (not a
    Pydantic model) so the agent-runtime startup hook can mutate
    ``failures`` and ``finalising_warnings`` in place during the pass
    without a fresh model copy per per-build update.

    Attributes:
        interrupted_count: Number of PREPARING / RUNNING / FINALISING
            builds that were transitioned to INTERRUPTED.
        paused_reissued_count: Number of PAUSED builds whose original
            approval request was re-published.
        finalising_warnings: Operator-facing warnings emitted for
            FINALISING crashes; each entry is
            ``"<build_id>: finalising-interrupted: PR may exist at <pr_url>"``
            (or "PR creation status unknown" when ``pr_url`` is null).
            The operator must manually verify whether a GitHub PR was
            opened before the crash.
        failures: Per-build handler failures. Each entry is
            ``(build_id, exception)``. A non-empty ``failures`` list
            does NOT abort the pass — every other build is still
            reconciled.
        skipped_count: Number of builds that required no action
            (QUEUED, INTERRUPTED). Useful for boot-log diagnostics: a
            very high value indicates the previous process was largely
            idle when it crashed.
