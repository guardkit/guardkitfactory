"""Boot-time migration runner for the Forge SQLite substrate.

Public surface
==============

- :func:`apply_at_boot` — execute every migration whose version exceeds
  the highest row currently in ``schema_version``.

Design notes (DDR-003 + TASK-PSM-002)
-------------------------------------

The schema is shipped as a real ``schema.sql`` file inside this
package — see :mod:`importlib.resources`. ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``
plus ``INSERT OR IGNORE INTO schema_version`` make the script safe to
re-run on every boot, which is what gives us the *idempotent*
acceptance criterion for free: running ``apply_at_boot`` against an
already-migrated database is a no-op (no extra rows, no schema drift).

The runner wraps the executescript in a single transaction. A failure
inside the script rolls back the whole boot — partial schema is the
worst possible recovery state, so we'd rather raise loudly and let the
caller surface the error.

    ``schema_version`` seed row uses ``INSERT OR IGNORE``.

    ----------
    connection:
        A writable ``sqlite3.Connection`` — typically the persistent
        connection returned by
        :func:`forge.adapters.sqlite.connect.connect_writer`.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The schema version after the migrations have been applied
        (i.e. the highest version present in ``schema_version``).

    Raises
    ------
    MigrationError

        exception is preserved as ``__cause__``.
