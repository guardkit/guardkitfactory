"""Lifecycle state machine — transition table and invariants (TASK-PSM-004).

This module is the **sole producer of** :class:`Transition` value objects.
The persistence layer's ``apply_transition()`` (TASK-PSM-005) is the only
caller permitted to write the ``builds.status`` column, and it accepts a
:class:`Transition` produced here. CLI commands (queue / cancel / skip)
and the recovery pass import :func:`transition` from this module to
compose state changes; they never write ``status`` directly.

This is concern **sc_001** in the FEAT-FORGE-001 review — the single most
important architectural rule in the feature. Without a single producer of
state transitions, the cancel/skip handlers, queue command, and recovery
pass could each write status independently and produce illegal states
(e.g. ``COMPLETE → RUNNING``, ``FAILED → COMPLETE``). The transition
table here is the authoritative graph; :func:`transition` enforces it.

Allowed transitions
-------------------

::

    QUEUED       → PREPARING, INTERRUPTED, CANCELLED
    PREPARING    → RUNNING, FAILED, INTERRUPTED, CANCELLED
    RUNNING      → PAUSED, FINALISING, FAILED, INTERRUPTED, CANCELLED, SKIPPED
    PAUSED       → RUNNING, FINALISING, FAILED, CANCELLED, SKIPPED
    FINALISING   → COMPLETE, FAILED, INTERRUPTED
    INTERRUPTED  → QUEUED, PREPARING        # re-pickup after recovery
    COMPLETE     → ()                       # terminal
    FAILED       → ()                       # terminal
    CANCELLED    → ()                       # terminal
    SKIPPED      → ()                       # terminal

Terminal states (COMPLETE / FAILED / CANCELLED / SKIPPED) accept no
outgoing transitions, and any transition *into* a terminal state must
record ``completed_at`` (Group G data-integrity invariant). When a
caller does not pass ``completed_at`` explicitly, :func:`transition`
sets it to the same UTC instant as ``occurred_at``.

    """Compose and return a validated :class:`Transition` value object.

    Reads the build's current state from ``build.status`` (any object
    with that attribute — typically the ``Build`` Pydantic model from
    TASK-PSM-003), checks the proposed move against
    :data:`TRANSITION_TABLE`, and returns a frozen :class:`Transition`
    on success. Raises :class:`InvalidTransitionError` when the move is
    not in the table.

    Terminal-state transitions populate ``completed_at`` automatically
    when the caller does not pass one; the value mirrors ``occurred_at``
    so a single UTC instant identifies the transition end-to-end.

    Args:
        build: An object exposing ``status: BuildState`` and
            ``build_id: str``. The supervisor's ``Build`` model is the
            production caller.

            :class:`Transition` value object — ``error``, ``pr_url``,
            ``pending_approval_request_id``, and an explicit
            ``completed_at`` override. Unknown keys cause Pydantic to
