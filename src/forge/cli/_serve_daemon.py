"""``forge serve`` daemon body — JetStream durable consumer (TASK-F009-003 / TASK-FW10-001).

This module owns the long-running side of ``forge serve``. It connects to
NATS (or accepts an injected client from :mod:`forge.cli.serve` —
ASSUM-011), attaches to the **shared** JetStream durable consumer named
:data:`forge.cli._serve_config.DEFAULT_DURABLE_NAME` ("forge-serve") on
subject ``pipeline.build-queued.*``, pulls payloads, and hands them to
the orchestrator dispatcher.

Behaviour summary (see TASK-F009-003 + TASK-FW10-001 acceptance
criteria):

* ``run_daemon`` returns only on cancellation / signal — otherwise loops
  forever (AC: starts and stays running until SIGTERM).
* The pull subscription uses ``durable=DEFAULT_DURABLE_NAME`` exactly,
  on the shared :data:`PIPELINE_STREAM_NAME` stream, with explicit ack
  policy and ``max_ack_pending=1`` so the broker never holds more than
  one un-acked envelope per durable (ADR-ARCH-014, TASK-FW10-001 §2).
  Editing this field on a live consumer is rejected by JetStream — the
  rollout note in TASK-FW10-001 calls for ``nats consumer rm`` of the
  existing durable before deploying.
* :class:`SubscriptionState.live` flips to ``True`` only after the
  pull subscription is bound; it flips to ``False`` on broker loss
  and again at clean shutdown.
* Broker-outage recovery is JetStream-defaults only (ASSUM-007): we
  reconnect with bounded backoff and re-attach the same durable. The
  reconnect path opens a fresh client via the :data:`nats_connect`
  seam (only the **first** attach uses the injected ``client`` from
  ``_run_serve`` — see TASK-FW10-001 AC-006).
* SIGTERM / SIGINT are wired via :func:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.add_signal_handler`
  when available; the daemon also exits cleanly on
  :class:`asyncio.CancelledError`.
* Unacked messages stay pending on the consumer for redelivery (E2.1).
* A failed dispatch acks the message itself (releases the queue slot)
  and the daemon continues with the next payload (E3.1). On the
  **success** path the dispatcher (or the state machine via
  :func:`forge.adapters.nats.pipeline_consumer.handle_message`'s
  ``ack_callback``) owns terminal-only ack — ``_process_message`` does
  not ack on success (TASK-FW10-001 §2 + AC-002).

Module-level seams (rebindable by tests):

- :data:`nats_connect` — ``async (servers: str) -> client``.
- :data:`dispatch_payload` — ``async (msg: _MsgLike) -> None``.

Tests monkey-patch these to drive the daemon without a real broker.
The new ``DispatchFn`` signature is ``(_MsgLike) -> Awaitable[None]``
(TASK-FW10-001 AC-001) — the dispatcher receives the whole message so
it can ack on terminal completion through ``ack_callback`` semantics
rather than the daemon acking unconditionally.
