"""Composition of :class:`PipelineConsumerDeps` for ``forge serve`` (TASK-FW10-007).

This module is the Wave-3 composition step that turns the five Wave-2
collaborator factories
(:mod:`forge.cli._serve_deps_forward_context`,
:mod:`forge.cli._serve_deps_stage_log`,
:mod:`forge.cli._serve_deps_state_channel`,
:mod:`forge.cli._serve_deps_lifecycle`)
plus the SQLite duplicate-detection helper into the single
:class:`~forge.adapters.nats.pipeline_consumer.PipelineConsumerDeps`
container the inbound consumer state machine consumes.

What this module wires
----------------------

* ``forge_config`` — passed straight through; the consumer reads
  ``forge_config.pipeline.approved_originators`` and
  ``forge_config.permissions.filesystem.allowlist`` for its rejection
  rules (FEAT-FORGE-002 §2 + §3).
* ``is_duplicate_terminal`` — bound to a SQLite ``SELECT status`` against
  the unique ``(feature_id, correlation_id)`` index on the ``builds``
  table (per ASSUM-014). Returns ``True`` only when the row's
  :class:`~forge.lifecycle.state_machine.BuildState` is one of
  :data:`~forge.lifecycle.state_machine.TERMINAL_STATES`
  (``COMPLETE``/``FAILED``/``CANCELLED``/``SKIPPED``).
* ``dispatch_build`` — a thin closure that records the pending
  ``builds`` row, then calls
  :func:`forge.pipeline.dispatchers.autobuild_async.dispatch_autobuild_async`
  with the three Wave-2 Protocol collaborators
  (:class:`ForwardContextBuilder`, :class:`StageLogRecorder`,
  :class:`AutobuildStateInitialiser`) plus the injected
  :class:`AsyncTaskStarter`. Terminal-only ack of the JetStream
  message is owned by ``pipeline_consumer.handle_message``'s
  ``ack_callback`` — the closure does **not** ack itself (see
  TASK-FW10-001 AC-002).
* ``publish_build_failed`` — bound to
  :meth:`forge.adapters.nats.PipelinePublisher.publish_build_failed`
  via the publisher constructed by
  :func:`forge.cli._serve_deps_lifecycle.build_publisher_and_emitter`.
  The wrapper swallows the ``feature_id`` argument the consumer
  Protocol passes (the publisher derives the subject from
  ``payload.feature_id`` itself).

Single-client invariant (ASSUM-011)
-----------------------------------

Per the IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md §5 boot order, ``_run_serve`` opens
exactly one NATS client and shares it across the daemon, the
publisher/emitter, and this deps factory. We accept the pre-opened
``client`` and pass it to
:func:`build_publisher_and_emitter` rather than dialling a second
connection here.

Per-build ``AsyncTaskStarter`` is supervisor-owned (TASK-FW10-008)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The :class:`~forge.pipeline.dispatchers.autobuild_async.AsyncTaskStarter`
Protocol is the LangGraph ``AsyncSubAgentMiddleware`` ``start_async_task``
seam (per ADR-ARCH-031). Wiring of the Supervisor and middleware is
TASK-FW10-008's responsibility. Until that lands the deps factory
accepts ``async_task_starter`` as an optional kwarg — production
callers will pass the middleware-backed starter, while unit tests pass
a deterministic fake. When ``None``, the closure raises a clear
``RuntimeError`` rather than silently no-oping; this surfaces the
missing wiring loudly during integration rather than letting a build
disappear into a queue that has no runner attached.
