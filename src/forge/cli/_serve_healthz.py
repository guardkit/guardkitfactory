"""``forge serve`` healthz HTTP server (TASK-F009-004 implementation).

This module owns the boundary surface for the readiness-probe side of
``forge serve``. It binds an :mod:`aiohttp` HTTP server to
``ServeConfig.healthz_port`` (Integration Contract B; default ``8080``)
and exposes a single endpoint:

- ``GET /healthz`` -> ``200`` with ``{"status": "healthy"}`` when
  ``SubscriptionState.is_live()`` returns ``True``.
- ``GET /healthz`` -> ``503`` with
  ``{"status": "unhealthy", "reason": "subscription_not_live"}``
  otherwise.
- All other paths and verbs return ``404``/``405`` (E1.3 — no
  remote-access endpoints).

The split between :mod:`forge.cli._serve_daemon` and
:mod:`forge.cli._serve_healthz` exists so T3 (daemon body) and T4 (this
file) could land independently in Wave 2 without colliding on a single
``serve.py``. Do not consolidate later.

Runtime model
-------------

``run_healthz_server`` is a coroutine designed to live forever inside
``asyncio.gather(run_daemon(...), run_healthz_server(...))``. It returns
only by being cancelled — typically when ``serve_cmd`` propagates a
``SIGTERM`` cancellation or when the daemon coroutine raises and
``gather`` cancels its sibling. The ``finally`` block always invokes
``runner.cleanup()`` so the listening socket is released cleanly with no
port leak across restarts.

Implementation notes from the task:

- The :mod:`aiohttp` package is already a transitive dependency of
  ``langchain`` / ``langgraph`` / ``langchain-anthropic`` (verified at
  install time), so we deliberately avoid adding a new HTTP framework.
- ``SubscriptionState`` is mutated by the daemon side of
  ``forge serve`` and read here. Both coroutines share a single
  ``SubscriptionState`` instance built by ``serve_cmd`` so producer and
  consumer cannot drift.
- The :func:`build_healthz_app` factory exists so unit tests can
  exercise the request handler with ``aiohttp.test_utils.TestClient``
  without binding a real TCP socket.

    Returns ``200``/``healthy`` only when **both** readiness flags are
    True (TASK-FW10-001 ASSUM-012):

    * ``state.live`` — JetStream subscription is bound (Acceptance
      Criterion B5).
    * ``state.chain_ready`` — orchestrator dispatch chain has been
      composed and both ``reconcile_on_boot`` routines have completed.

    Otherwise the endpoint returns ``503``/``unhealthy`` and the
    ``reason`` field distinguishes which gate is closed:

    * ``chain_not_ready`` — chain composition / reconcile_on_boot has
      not finished (kubelet should keep the pod out of the Service
      until reconcile completes).
    * ``subscription_not_live`` — chain is ready but the broker is
      gone (Group E scenario row 3 — the daemon is composed but the
      pull subscription has dropped).

    We do not take the lock on the read side: the booleans are atomic
    attribute reads under Python's GIL, and a one-tick-stale read is
    the explicit contract for the readiness probe (TASK-F009-001
    AC-006). ``chain_ready`` order matters in the response: it is
    checked first because an unready chain is a stronger signal — if
    the chain has not been composed, the ``live`` flag is meaningless
    (the daemon may not have attached yet).
