"""Shared subscription state for the ``forge serve`` daemon (TASK-F009-001 / TASK-FW10-001).

The daemon (writer) and the healthz HTTP server (reader) need to agree on
two booleans — *is the JetStream subscription currently live?* and *has
the lifecycle dispatch chain been composed?* — to implement the readiness
probe mandated by Integration Contract B (``HEALTHZ_PORT = 8080``).

This module defines the boundary type: a small ``SubscriptionState``
dataclass with:

* ``live: bool`` — flipped by :mod:`forge.cli._serve_daemon` when the
  JetStream pull subscription is bound (writer) / lost (writer) /
  shutting down (writer).
* ``chain_ready: bool`` — flipped by :mod:`forge.cli.serve` exactly once,
  after the orchestrator dispatch chain has been composed and both
  ``reconcile_on_boot`` routines (lifecycle recovery + redelivery
  reconciliation) have completed (TASK-FW10-001 ASSUM-012).

Both fields are guarded by an ``asyncio.Lock`` on the writer side. Reads
return the cached boolean without taking the lock — Python's GIL
guarantees attribute reads are atomic, and a stale-by-one-tick read is
acceptable for a readiness probe (TASK-F009-001 AC-006).

Wave-2 tasks T3 (daemon), T4 (healthz), and TASK-FW10-001 (boot wiring)
import :class:`SubscriptionState` and share a single instance built by
``serve_cmd`` so the producer and consumer cannot drift.
