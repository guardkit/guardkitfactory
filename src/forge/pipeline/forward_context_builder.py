"""Forward-propagation context builder for FEAT-FORGE-007 Mode A (TASK-MAG7-006).

This module defines :class:`ForwardContextBuilder`, the *only* place in the
Mode A pipeline that crosses the boundary from "the build's recorded
history" (``stage_log``) to "what gets passed to a downstream subprocess"
(``--context`` flag values on the next stage's dispatch).

It implements forward propagation per the
:data:`forge.pipeline.forward_propagation.PROPAGATION_CONTRACT` defined by
TASK-MAG7-002 and mitigates Risk R-5 ("forward-propagation context builder
leaks unapproved or stale artefacts") by centralising two read-side filters
in one auditable place:

1. *Approved-only*: a downstream stage receives context only from
   ``stage_log`` rows whose ``gate_decision == 'approved'``. In-progress
   and flagged-for-review rows are invisible to the builder by Protocol
   contract — :meth:`StageLogReader.get_approved_stage_entry` returns
   ``None`` for any row that has not reached the terminal-approved state.
2. *Worktree allowlisted*: every artefact path is checked against the
   build's :class:`WorktreeAllowlist` before it is threaded into a
   ``--context`` value. Paths that fall outside the worktree are filtered
   out individually and a structured warning is logged. This is the
   defence-in-depth twin of the FEAT-FORGE-005 allowlist that the build
   subprocess applies on its own side.

Per-feature scoping (FEAT-FORGE-007 ASSUM-001) is handled by passing
``feature_id`` through to the reader for any consumer or producer stage
in :data:`~forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy.PER_FEATURE_STAGES`. A consumer
that is per-feature but called without a ``feature_id`` is treated as a
misuse and yields an empty context list — the same "refuse rather than
dispatch cross-feature" stance taken by
:class:`forge.pipeline.stage_ordering_guard.StageOrderingGuard`
(TASK-MAG7-003).

Architecture notes
------------------

The builder is I/O-thin: it owns no state across calls and depends only
on the two reader Protocols (:class:`StageLogReader`,
:class:`WorktreeAllowlist`) declared in this module. Production wires the
FEAT-FORGE-001 SQLite adapter for the stage_log reader and the
FEAT-FORGE-005 allowlist for the worktree gate; tests inject in-memory
fakes — the same shape TASK-MAG7-003 and TASK-MAG7-005 use.

           how AC-007 ("in-progress prior stage → empty context") is

           ``"path-list"`` → one entry per element of ``artefact_paths``.
        5. For path-shaped entries, run each path through
           :meth:`WorktreeAllowlist.is_allowed`; rejects are dropped
           with a structured ``WARNING`` log line that names the path

        * Otherwise the contract from :data:`MODE_B_PROPAGATION_CONTRACT`
          is consulted. The shape of each row mirrors the matching Mode A

          one ``--context`` path entry per allow-listed
          ``review_artefact_paths`` element (Group L lineage).

          cycle) consumes every approved ``/task-work`` row for the
          build via
          :meth:`StageLogReader.get_all_approved_stage_entries`, emitting
          one ``--context`` path entry per allow-listed artefact path.

          covered by the TASK-MBC8-005 acceptance criteria and will be
          wired up by the relevant follow-up tasks
          (e.g. ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` Mode C handling lives with the
