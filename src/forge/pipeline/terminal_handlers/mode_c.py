"""Mode C terminal-state handler — empty review, no commits, PR review (TASK-MBC8-007).

Mode C has three terminal-routing outcomes after the cycle planner
exhausts its fix-task fan-out (FEAT-FORGE-008 ASSUM-005, ASSUM-007,
ASSUM-017):

* :attr:`ModeCTerminal.CLEAN_REVIEW_NO_FIXES` — the *initial*
  ``/task-review`` returned an empty fix-task list. No ``/task-work``
  was dispatched and the build completes immediately.
* :attr:`ModeCTerminal.CLEAN_REVIEW_NO_COMMITS` — every dispatched
  ``/task-work`` ran to a terminal status and at least one was
  approved, but the build's worktree shows zero commits between the
  build's base and HEAD. The constitutional PR-review gate has nothing
  to fire on, so the build completes with no PR creation attempt.
* :attr:`ModeCTerminal.PR_REVIEW` — at least one ``/task-work`` was
  approved and the worktree carries one or more commits. Routing
  proceeds to :attr:`forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy.StageClass.PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`.
* :attr:`ModeCTerminal.FAILED` — either the most recent ``/task-review``
  was hard-stopped/rejected, or every dispatched ``/task-work`` ended
  in a failed terminal lifecycle, or the commit-count probe itself
  failed (``"mode-c-commit-check-failed"``). A probe failure is **not**
  silently demoted to a clean review — the build is recorded as
  failed and the operator gets the underlying error in the rationale.

This module is the **single decision point** for Mode C terminal
routing. The planner (``forge.pipeline.mode_c_planner``) handles the
mid-cycle fan-out; this handler handles the cycle's exit.

The handler also exposes two small helpers for the supervisor wiring:

* :func:`build_task_work_attribution` — builds the per-fix-task
  ``stage_log`` ``details`` payload so each ``TASK_WORK`` entry carries
  ``fix_task_id``, ``originating_review_entry_id``, and an
  ``artefact_paths`` list filtered to only paths produced by *that* fix
  task (Group G "no artefact path attributed to more than one fix
  task" + Group L lineage).
* :func:`build_session_outcome_payload` — builds the
  :class:`forge.memory.models.SessionOutcome` payload for the
  decision; CLEAN_REVIEW_* outcomes carry no ``pull_request_url`` and
  no PR-review gate decision (Group N "session outcome reflects mode
  terminal").
