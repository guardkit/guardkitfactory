"""Specialist-stage dispatcher for product-owner and architect (TASK-MAG7-007).

This module is the thin composition layer that wires the three
upstream contracts the Mode A specialist stages depend on:

1. :class:`~forge.pipeline.forward_context_builder.ForwardContextBuilder`
   (TASK-MAG7-006) — builds the ``--context`` payload entries the
   downstream specialist receives.
2. FEAT-FORGE-003's specialist-dispatch surface
   (:class:`~forge.dispatch.orchestrator.DispatchOrchestrator`) — owns
   capability resolution, correlation-key fabrication, persistence,
   the subscribe-before-publish ordering, and reply parsing. The
   dispatcher in this module never re-implements any of that; it only
   *calls* it.
3. A narrow :class:`StageLogWriter` Protocol — records the
   ``stage_log`` row on submit and updates it on reply with the
   parsed Coach score and detection findings.

The dispatcher itself fans the work out for exactly two stages —
:attr:`~forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy.StageClass.PRODUCT_OWNER` and
:attr:`~forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy.StageClass.ARCHITECT` — and
refuses (raises :class:`ValueError`) for any other stage class. This
matches FEAT-FORGE-007 Group A where the product-owner and architect
are the only specialist stages: every other stage is a subprocess
(:mod:`forge.pipeline.dispatchers.subprocess`, TASK-MAG7-008) or an
async autobuild (:mod:`forge.pipeline.dispatchers.autobuild`,
TASK-MAG7-009) and travels via a different surface.

Outcome translation
-------------------

The FEAT-FORGE-003 :data:`~forge.dispatch.models.DispatchOutcome`
discriminated union is translated into the dispatcher-local
:class:`StageDispatchResult` that the gating layer (FEAT-FORGE-004)
consumes:

Retry-with-context behaviour on soft timeout is invoked at the
supervisor layer, **not** here. This module's only job is to thread
the structured result back so the supervisor can decide.
