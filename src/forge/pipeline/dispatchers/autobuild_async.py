"""Async autobuild dispatcher (TASK-MAG7-009, FEAT-FORGE-007).

Dispatches a feature's autobuild as a long-running ``AsyncSubAgent`` via the
DeepAgents ``start_async_task`` middleware tool (per ADR-ARCH-031). The call
returns immediately with the assigned ``task_id`` so the supervisor's
reasoning loop stays responsive while autobuild executes in the background
(FEAT-FORGE-007 Group A: "Autobuild runs as an asynchronous subagent so the
supervisor remains responsive during long runs").

Design invariants
-----------------

1. *Forward context* — the autobuild subagent is launched with the
   approved feature-plan artefact path resolved via
   :class:`forge.pipeline.forward_context_builder.ForwardContextBuilder`
   (TASK-MAG7-006). The dispatcher does not read ``stage_log`` directly;
   it threads whatever the builder returns, so the approval and
   worktree-allowlist filters live in exactly one place.

2. *Crash-recovery durability* — the ``stage_log`` row is written
   **before** ``start_async_task`` is awaited. If the process dies
   between submit and ack, durable history (FEAT-FORGE-001 SQLite)
   reflects the dispatch attempt even when the live ``async_tasks``
   state channel does not. This satisfies FEAT-FORGE-007 Group D
   @edge-case "After a crash mid-autobuild the build's authoritative
   status comes from durable history not the live state channel" —
   the dispatcher's contribution is to never leave a state-channel
   entry without a paired ``stage_log`` row.

3. *Single live entry per (build_id, feature_id, autobuild)* — both the
   ``stage_log`` recorder and the state-channel initialiser are upsert
   shaped (idempotent on the natural key). The dispatcher writes the
   ``stage_log`` row twice on the happy path: once before
   ``start_async_task`` (no ``task_id`` yet) and once after, with the
   assigned ``task_id`` threaded into ``details_json``.

4. *correlation_id is threaded everywhere* — the originating
   ``correlation_id`` lands on (a) the ``stage_log`` row's
   ``details_json``, (b) the launched task's context payload, and (c)
   the ``async_tasks`` state-channel ``AutobuildState`` entry. This is
   the FEAT-FORGE-007 Group I @data-integrity contract: every
   downstream observation of the autobuild can be correlated back to
   the build that triggered it.

5. *No lifecycle progression here* — the dispatcher writes the initial
   ``lifecycle="starting"`` state-channel entry and exits. The
   subsequent transitions through ``planning_waves``, ``running_wave``,
   ``awaiting_approval``, ``completed`` (etc.) are written by
   ``autobuild_runner`` itself (FEAT-FORGE-005 + ADR-ARCH-031).

Concurrency
-----------

Two concurrent builds dispatching autobuild at the same time get
distinct ``task_id`` values because the ``AsyncTaskStarter`` Protocol
contract requires ``start_async_task`` to mint a fresh identifier per
call. The dispatcher is otherwise stateless — every dependency is
injected, so the same instance can be called from concurrent supervisors
without ownership ambiguity (Group F @concurrency).

    Workflow (in execution order — the order is part of the contract,
    not an implementation detail):

    1. **Resolve forward context.** Call
       :meth:`ForwardContextBuilder.build_for` for
       :attr:`StageClass.AUTOBUILD` to get the approved feature-plan
       artefact path (and any other entries the propagation contract
       declares for the autobuild stage). The builder enforces the
       approval and worktree-allowlist filters internally.

    2. **Record ``stage_log`` BEFORE submit.** Upsert a ``running`` row
       with ``correlation_id`` and the resolved context entries in
       ``details_json`` — but no ``task_id`` yet. This is the
       durability invariant: even if the process dies between this
       write and the ``start_async_task`` ack, the SQLite row records
       that a dispatch was attempted.

    3. **Invoke ``start_async_task``.** Call the middleware tool with
       :data:`AUTOBUILD_RUNNER_NAME` and a context payload that carries
       ``build_id``, ``feature_id``, ``correlation_id``, and the
       serialised context entries. The call returns the assigned
       ``task_id`` synchronously; the actual subagent work runs in the
       background.

    4. **Re-record ``stage_log``** with the ``task_id`` threaded into
       ``details_json``. The upsert semantics of the recorder mean we
       end up with a single live row whose ``details_json`` reflects
       the assigned ``task_id`` (Group I @data-integrity).

    5. **Initialise ``async_tasks`` state-channel entry.** Write the
       :class:`AutobuildStateLike` row with

       ``task_index=0``, and ``correlation_id`` threaded.

       the in-flight autobuild and (eventually) reconcile it with the

        build_id: The build the dispatch is scoped to. Used as the
            primary key on every downstream write.
        feature_id: The feature whose autobuild to dispatch. Required
            because :attr:`StageClass.AUTOBUILD` is per-feature
            (FEAT-FORGE-007 Group B).
        correlation_id: The originating correlation ID. Threaded through
            every downstream observation; per FEAT-FORGE-002, this is
            the only way to correlate published events across the
            stack.
        forward_context_builder: Builder that resolves
            ``--context`` entries for the autobuild stage. Approval and
            allowlist filters live inside the builder, not here.
        async_task_starter: The DeepAgents ``start_async_task`` middleware
            tool, satisfying :class:`AsyncTaskStarter`.
        stage_log_recorder: Upsert-shaped ``stage_log`` writer,
            satisfying :class:`StageLogRecorder`.
        state_channel: Upsert-shaped ``async_tasks`` state-channel
            writer, satisfying :class:`AutobuildStateInitialiser`.

    Returns:
        :class:`AutobuildDispatchHandle` carrying the minted ``task_id``
        and the four identifiers the supervisor needs.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any of ``build_id``, ``feature_id``, or
            ``correlation_id`` is empty. The dispatcher refuses to
