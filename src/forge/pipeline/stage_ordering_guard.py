"""Executor-layer guard for the Mode A stage-ordering invariant (TASK-MAG7-003).

This module implements the executor-layer half of the FEAT-FORGE-007 Group B
stage-ordering invariant: a downstream Mode A stage is **never** dispatched
before every prerequisite stage has reached the approved state in the
``stage_log``.

It is the belt-and-braces twin of the reasoning-model prompt — the reasoning
model may *choose* a stage, but :class:`StageOrderingGuard` is what the
supervisor consults before actually dispatching it. Because this module is a
pure function (no async, no I/O behind the injected
:class:`StageLogReader` Protocol), the reasoning model cannot bypass it via
prompt drift (ADR-ARCH-026).

Per-feature semantics (FEAT-FORGE-007 ASSUM-001):

- ``PRODUCT_OWNER``, ``ARCHITECT``, ``SYSTEM_ARCH``, ``SYSTEM_DESIGN`` run
  once per Mode A pipeline. Approval is recorded against the ``build_id``
  with no ``feature_id`` scope.
- ``FEATURE_SPEC``, ``FEATURE_PLAN``, ``AUTOBUILD`` run **once per feature**
  (Group B Scenario Outline rows 5–6, "feature-plan ← feature-spec for
  that feature"). Approval is recorded against ``(build_id, feature_id)``.
- ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` is the constitutional terminator. Group B row 7
  ("pull-request ← autobuild for every feature") makes it dispatchable
  only when ``AUTOBUILD`` is approved for *every* feature in the
  build's catalogue. An empty catalogue is therefore not dispatchable —
  there is nothing to review.

        The decision tree mirrors the seven Group B Scenario Outline rows:

        1. ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` is special-cased — it requires
           ``AUTOBUILD`` approved for *every* feature in
           ``stage_log_reader.feature_catalogue(build_id)`` (row 7) when
           the Mode A prerequisite map is in effect; under per-mode maps
           that explicitly list ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` (Mode B / Mode C
           via :mod:`forge.pipeline.mode_chains_data`) the listed
           prerequisite is consulted instead.
        2. Stages with no prerequisites entry in the active prerequisite
           map (i.e. the entry stage for the mode — ``PRODUCT_OWNER`` for
           Mode A, ``FEATURE_SPEC`` for Mode B, ``TASK_REVIEW`` for
           Mode C) are trivially dispatchable.
        3. Per-feature stages other than ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` —
           ``FEATURE_SPEC``, ``FEATURE_PLAN``, ``AUTOBUILD`` — require
           ``feature_id`` to be supplied. Without it the guard refuses
           rather than checking against the wrong scope.
        4. Otherwise: every prerequisite must be approved. A
           prerequisite that is itself per-feature is checked at the
           same ``feature_id`` (rows 5 and 6: "feature-plan ←
           feature-spec for that feature"); a non-per-feature
           prerequisite is checked with ``feature_id=None``.

            stage: The stage class the supervisor wants to dispatch.
            stage_log_reader: Injected reader over the ``stage_log`` table.

                ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW``; ignored for non-per-feature
                stages. ``None`` by default.
