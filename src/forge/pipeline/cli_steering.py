"""CLI steering injection handler (TASK-MAG7-011, FEAT-FORGE-007).

This module owns :class:`CliSteeringHandler` — the executor-layer surface
the FEAT-FORGE-001 CLI commands (``forge cancel``, ``forge skip``, and the
mid-flight directive command) call into. The handler turns the operator's
CLI verb into the corresponding pause-resolution / async-task-middleware
side effect, observing the constitutional-guard veto rules from
ADR-ARCH-026 and the synthetic-decision mapping declared in
FEAT-FORGE-004 ASSUM-005 (cancel → reject, skip → override).

Why this is the executor layer
------------------------------

The CLI commands themselves (FEAT-FORGE-001) are intentionally thin: they
parse argv, marshal IDs, and dispatch to this handler. Every behavioural
rule — "cancel-during-pause resolves as a synthetic reject", "skip on a
constitutional stage is refused", "mid-flight directives are queued onto
``AutobuildState.pending_directives``" — lives here, in one auditable
module. This mirrors the executor-layer pattern already established by
:class:`~forge.pipeline.constitutional_guard.ConstitutionalGuard` and
:class:`~forge.pipeline.supervisor.Supervisor`: I/O is injected through
narrow :class:`typing.Protocol` seams; the handler owns no mutable
per-build state.

Group coverage
--------------

* **Group D edge cases**:
  - cancel during a flagged-for-review pause → synthetic reject →
    terminal ``CANCELLED`` (AC-002).
  - cancel during an in-flight autobuild → ``cancel_async_task`` is
    called and the build is marked ``CANCELLED`` with no PR creation
    attempted (AC-002).
  - cancel from any other non-terminal state → terminal ``CANCELLED``
    and no further dispatch is permitted (AC-002).
  - skip on a non-constitutional stage → stage logged ``SKIPPED`` and
    the build resumes at the next stage (AC-003 / AC-006).
  - mid-flight directive on an active autobuild → enqueued onto
    ``AutobuildState.pending_directives`` via ``update_async_task``;
    the autobuild itself decides when (and whether) to honour it
    (AC-004).

* **Group C @negative @regression**:
  - skip on the PR-review stage (or any other stage in
    :data:`~forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy.CONSTITUTIONAL_STAGES`) is
    refused via :meth:`ConstitutionalGuard.veto_skip`; the refusal
    rationale is recorded and the build remains paused (AC-007).
