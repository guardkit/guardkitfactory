"""Supervisor reasoning-loop dispatch turn (TASK-MAG7-010, FEAT-FORGE-007).

This module owns the **reasoning-loop turn function** the FEAT-FORGE-007
supervisor runs once per build per outer-loop iteration. Each call to
:meth:`Supervisor.next_turn`:

1. Reads the build's current state from the FEAT-FORGE-001 state machine
   (via the injected :class:`StateMachineReader` Protocol).
2. Asks :class:`~forge.pipeline.stage_ordering_guard.StageOrderingGuard`
   for the set of dispatchable stages (TASK-MAG7-003 belt-and-braces).
3. Presents the permitted set + per-stage forward-propagation hints
   (TASK-MAG7-002) to the reasoning model and parses the chosen
   dispatch.
4. Re-checks the model's choice against the permitted set — refuses with
   a structured warning if the model hallucinates an out-of-band stage.
5. Applies the per-feature autobuild sequencer
   (:class:`~forge.pipeline.per_feature_sequencer.PerFeatureLoopSequencer`,
   TASK-MAG7-005) for ``AUTOBUILD`` choices.
6. Applies the constitutional guard
   (:class:`~forge.pipeline.constitutional_guard.ConstitutionalGuard`,
   TASK-MAG7-004) for ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` gate decisions.
7. Routes the (verified) dispatch to the correct dispatcher:

   ============================  ====================================
   Stage class                   Dispatcher
   ============================  ====================================
   ``PRODUCT_OWNER``             specialist (TASK-MAG7-007)
   ``ARCHITECT``                 specialist (TASK-MAG7-007)
   ``SYSTEM_ARCH``               subprocess  (TASK-MAG7-008)
   ``SYSTEM_DESIGN``             subprocess  (TASK-MAG7-008)
   ``FEATURE_SPEC``              subprocess  (TASK-MAG7-008)
   ``FEATURE_PLAN``              subprocess  (TASK-MAG7-008)
   ``AUTOBUILD``                 autobuild_async (TASK-MAG7-009)
   ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW``       gate decision (FEAT-FORGE-004)
   ============================  ====================================

8. Records the per-turn outcome (decision + rationale) in ``stage_log``
   via the injected :class:`StageLogTurnRecorder` Protocol.

The supervisor itself owns **no mutable state** keyed on ``build_id`` —
every dependency is injected, every method takes ``build_id`` explicitly,
and the same instance is safe to call from concurrent ``next_turn``
invocations on different builds (FEAT-FORGE-007 Group F @concurrency).

I/O-thinness is a hard requirement (TASK-MAG7-010 implementation notes):
this module never opens a SQLite connection, never spawns a process,
never reads NATS — it composes the guards and dispatchers from Waves 2
and 3 and lets *them* do the I/O behind their respective Protocols.

            ``TurnReport.dispatch_result`` carries the dispatcher's

            state (e.g. waiting on an approval response). The outer loop

        WAITING_PRIOR_AUTOBUILD: An ``AUTOBUILD`` was permitted by the
            stage-ordering guard, but the per-feature sequencer refused
            because a sibling feature's autobuild is still in flight.
        REFUSED_OUT_OF_BAND: The reasoning model picked a stage outside
            the permitted set. The supervisor refused to act and recorded
            a structured warning. The outer loop should retry the turn.
        REFUSED_CONSTITUTIONAL: A ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`` auto-approve
            was attempted and the constitutional guard refused. The PR
            stays gated for mandatory human approval.
        TERMINAL: The build is in a terminal state (COMPLETE / FAILED /
            CANCELLED). The supervisor will not produce further turns.
        NO_OP: The reasoning model declined to choose any stage (returned
            ``None``). This is distinct from ``WAITING``: the model

        targets are async; the per-feature autobuild and PR-review
        paths are sync but we keep the surface uniform.

        Sequence:

        1. Read the build state. Terminal → return ``TERMINAL``.
        2. Compute ``permitted_stages`` via the ordering guard.
           Empty + non-terminal → return ``WAITING``.
        3. Ask the reasoning model to pick one entry from the
           permitted set. ``None`` → return ``NO_OP``.
        4. Validate the choice is in the permitted set. Out-of-band
           → ``REFUSED_OUT_OF_BAND`` + structured warning log.
        5. For ``AUTOBUILD``: apply the per-feature sequencer.
           Refused → ``WAITING_PRIOR_AUTOBUILD``.
        6. For ``PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW``: apply the constitutional
           guard's ``veto_auto_approve`` to the model's auto-approve
           flag. Refused → ``REFUSED_CONSTITUTIONAL``.
        7. Route to the correct dispatcher and capture the result.
        8. Record a per-turn ``stage_log`` row regardless of outcome.

        Args:
            build_id: Build identifier the turn is for. Each
                ``next_turn`` call is independent — concurrent builds
                supply different ``build_id`` values and never share
                mutable supervisor state.

        Returns:
