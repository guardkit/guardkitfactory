"""Tests for the validation surface of ``pipeline_consumer.handle_message``.

This module pins TASK-FW10-009's six acceptance criteria — the Group C
negative-path scenarios from ``API-nats-pipeline-events.md §2.3``:

* AC-001: malformed payload → ``build-failed`` published, message acked,
  no orchestrator dispatch.
* AC-002: duplicate ``(feature_id, correlation_id)`` → ack + skip, no
  ``build-started`` (i.e. no orchestrator dispatch), no ``build-failed``.
* AC-003: ``feature_yaml_path`` outside the worktree allowlist →
  ``build-failed`` published BEFORE any ``dispatch_build`` invocation.
* AC-004: ``publish_build_failed`` raising on any rejection path →
  logged at WARNING, no exception propagates, no SQLite-recorded
  transition is regressed (ADR-ARCH-008).
* AC-005: ``dispatch_build`` raising during a build → exception
  contained, the inbound message is acked so the next build can be
  processed, daemon stays running.
* AC-006 (lint) — covered by project ruff/format gate; not asserted in
  Python here.

The collaborators of :class:`PipelineConsumerDeps` are stubbed with
``unittest.mock.AsyncMock`` so the tests exercise only ``handle_message``
itself — the real state-machine entry, SQLite duplicate read, and
NATS publisher are out of scope. Each ``Test*`` class maps to one
acceptance criterion to keep the criterion → verifier mapping explicit.
