"""Seam test: verify TASK-F009-008 fold of RUNBOOK §6 / §6.1.

Contract: ``BUILDKIT_INVOCATION`` (producer: TASK-F009-005). The
runbook §6.1 build command must be the canonical BuildKit invocation,
the pre-fold gating callout must be removed, and the operator-facing
shell block must say to ``cd`` to forge's parent directory before
invoking ``docker buildx``. The sibling ``nats-core`` working tree
prerequisite must also be documented.

This module is the per-task seam test for TASK-F009-008 (runbook fold
+ history append + stub move). The wider drift detector lives at
``tests/integration/test_forge_production_image.py`` and asserts the
literal substring is identical across every consumer file; this test
narrows the assertion to the runbook alone so the AC-J fold can fail
loudly during autobuild even if the wider drift detector is skipped.
