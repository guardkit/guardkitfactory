"""Integration tests for the FEAT-FORGE-009 production image (TASK-F009-006).

This module is the slow-tier counterpart to the BDD bindings in
``tests/bdd/test_forge_production_image.py`` and consolidates four
distinct concerns the task brief originally listed as separate files —
they're folded into one module here to respect the task-work
documentation-level=minimal file-count constraint while still
expressing every contract:

1. **BuildKit invocation drift detector (Contract A — TASK-F009-005).**
   Asserts the canonical ``docker buildx build ...`` line is identical
   across all consumer files (``scripts/build-image.sh``,
   ``.github/workflows/forge-image.yml``,
   ``docs/runbooks/RUNBOOK-FEAT-FORGE-008-validation.md``). Files that
   do not yet exist are reported as ``skip`` rather than ``fail`` so
   this drift detector lights up cleanly when the missing-file gap
   closes.

2. **ARFS gate (TASK-F009-006 AC-D).** Runs the manifest-build code
   path *inside* the built production image and asserts every fleet
   tool from ``src/forge/fleet/manifest.py`` is present. The fast-tier
   surrogate in the BDD file reads ``FORGE_MANIFEST`` directly; this
   slow-tier test exercises the same import via
   ``docker run forge:test python -c "from forge.fleet.manifest
   import FORGE_MANIFEST; ..."`` to catch the failure mode "manifest-
   build code path broken because forge wasn't installed as a proper
   distribution".

3. **D2 multi-replica exactly-once delivery.** Starts two
   ``forge:production-validation`` containers against a shared
   Testcontainers-style NATS broker, publishes one payload, asserts
   exactly one daemon picks it up using the durable consumer name read
   from ``forge.cli.serve.DEFAULT_DURABLE_NAME``.

4. **D3 broker-outage recovery.** Stops the NATS broker for ~5 s,
   restarts it, publishes during the outage window, and asserts the
   payload is delivered after the broker comes back.

The ``@pytest.mark.slow`` marker gates concerns 2/3/4 — the default
``pytest`` invocation excludes them; CI runs them via
``pytest -m slow tests/integration/test_forge_production_image.py``.

Cardinal rule (matches T6 task notes): this module **adds** tests; it
does not modify Dockerfile, scripts, or src/forge/. If a test failure
surfaces a bug in T3/T4/T5, file a Wave-2 follow-up rather than
patching here.
