# Task: Wire dispatch_specialist_stage for product-owner and architect

## Description

Compose FEAT-FORGE-003's specialist capability dispatch with the
`ForwardContextBuilder` to dispatch the two specialist stages
(`PRODUCT_OWNER`, `ARCHITECT`). The dispatcher records the dispatch in
`stage_log`, awaits the correlation-keyed reply, parses the Coach score, and
produces a stage-complete record consumable by the gating layer
(FEAT-FORGE-004).

Covers Group A: "A greenfield brief drives a full pipeline run" (specialist
half) and "The product-owner output is supplied as input to the architect
delegation".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `dispatch_specialist_stage(stage: StageClass, build_id: str, ...) -> StageDispatchResult`
      function exists at `src/forge/pipeline/dispatchers/specialist.py`
- [ ] Refuses any stage that is not in `{PRODUCT_OWNER, ARCHITECT}`
      (raises `ValueError` — programming error, not runtime)
- [ ] Calls `ForwardContextBuilder.build_for` to assemble the dispatch
      payload context
- [ ] Delegates to FEAT-FORGE-003's specialist-dispatch tool with the
      capability matching the stage (`product_owner_specialist`,
      `architect_specialist`)
- [ ] Threads the build's `correlation_id` through the dispatch envelope
      (Group I @data-integrity scenario)
- [ ] Records the dispatch as a `stage_log` entry on submit and updates on
      reply with the parsed Coach score and detection findings
- [ ] On degraded specialist (no healthy specialist on cache), returns a
      `StageDispatchResult.DEGRADED` outcome — gating layer maps to
      flag-for-review (Group C @negative scenario "no product-owner specialist")
- [ ] Unit test mocking FEAT-FORGE-003 dispatch surface: success path,
      degraded path, soft-timeout path (retry-with-context)
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with
      zero errors

## Implementation Notes

This dispatcher is a thin composition layer — it does not re-implement
specialist resolution, capability matching, or correlation handling. All of
that is owned by FEAT-FORGE-003. The dispatcher's job is to stitch the
forward-propagated context onto the specialist call and to write the
`stage_log` entry that downstream guards read.

The retry-with-context behaviour on soft failure (FEAT-FORGE-003 ASSUM-005,
"reasoning-model-driven retry; no fixed max-retry count") is invoked at the
supervisor layer, not here — this dispatcher returns the structured result
and lets the supervisor decide.
