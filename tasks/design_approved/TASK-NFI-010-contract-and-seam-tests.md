# Task: Contract + seam tests

## Description

Consolidate cross-module contract tests at the `nats_client` boundary and
the `FleetEventSink` seam. Each upstream subtask (004–009) has its own
unit tests; this task owns the *boundary* tests that guarantee
integration.

Test categories:

1. **`nats_client` boundary contracts** (assert publisher methods called with correct
   subject + envelope shape + `source_id="forge"` + correlation_id threading)
2. **`FleetEventSink` seam** (watcher → discovery cache delegation; asyncio.gather racing tests)
3. **Terminal-ack invariant** (pipeline_consumer ack called only on COMPLETE/FAILED/CANCELLED/SKIPPED; never on RUNNING/PAUSED/FINALISING)
4. **Secret-free manifest** (already in TASK-NFI-002; duplicate here at integration level)
5. **Clock injection coverage** (assert no `datetime.now()` or `asyncio.sleep(real)` calls in production code paths)
6. **Publish-failure tolerance** (publish raising → SQLite not rolled back)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Contract test: every `pipeline_publisher` method sends an envelope with `source_id == "forge"` and `correlation_id == payload.correlation_id`
- [ ] Contract test: `fleet_publisher.register_on_boot` calls `nats_client.register_agent(FORGE_MANIFEST)` exactly once with the manifest unchanged
- [ ] Contract test: `fleet_publisher.heartbeat_loop` calls `nats_client.heartbeat(...)` at cadence == `heartbeat_interval_seconds` (Clock-driven, not wall-clock)
- [ ] Seam test: `fleet_watcher.on_event(fleet.register)` → `sink.upsert_agent(manifest)` called; similar for deregister and heartbeat
- [ ] Racing seam test: 100 concurrent register+deregister pairs via `asyncio.gather` → cache ends in consistent state (one-event-wins)
- [ ] Terminal-ack invariant test: state machine runs through RUNNING → PAUSED → RUNNING → COMPLETE; `Msg.ack` is called exactly once, at COMPLETE
- [ ] Publish-failure tolerance test: mock `nats_client.publish` to raise on `build-started`; assert SQLite row still shows RUNNING after the raise
- [ ] Clock hygiene test: grep-based assertion that `src/forge/adapters/nats/` and `src/forge/discovery/` contain no `datetime.now()` or raw `asyncio.sleep(` calls (use `clock.now()` and `clock.sleep(` / `await event.wait()` instead)
- [ ] All tests pass in CI; coverage >= 80% for `forge.adapters.nats.*` and `forge.discovery.*`

## Implementation Notes

- Use `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` for `nats_client`
- `FakeClock` helper in `tests/helpers/fake_clock.py` — single `now()` method backed by a mutable `datetime`; `advance(seconds)` increments it
- Terminal-ack test is the single most load-bearing test in this feature — invest in clarity
