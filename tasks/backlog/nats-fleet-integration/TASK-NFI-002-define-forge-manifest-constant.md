# Task: Define FORGE_MANIFEST constant builder

## Description

Create `src/forge/fleet/manifest.py` exporting `FORGE_MANIFEST` — the
`nats_core.manifest.AgentManifest` describing Forge's intents, tools,
trust tier, and permissions. This is the payload published on startup
to `fleet.register` and stored in the `agent-registry` KV bucket.

The exact manifest content is specified in
`docs/design/contracts/API-nats-fleet-lifecycle.md §2.1` — copy it
verbatim. This is a declarative constant, not a runtime-computed value.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/forge/fleet/manifest.py` exports a module-level `FORGE_MANIFEST` constant
- [ ] Type is `nats_core.manifest.AgentManifest` (imported, not redeclared)
- [ ] `agent_id == "forge"`, `trust_tier == "core"`, `max_concurrent == 1`
- [ ] Three `IntentCapability` entries (build.* / pipeline.* / feature.*) match §2.1 verbatim
- [ ] Five `ToolCapability` entries (forge_greenfield, forge_feature, forge_review_fix, forge_status, forge_cancel) match §2.1 verbatim
- [ ] `required_permissions` matches §2.1 verbatim
- [ ] **Secret-free**: `FORGE_MANIFEST.model_dump_json()` contains none of `"api_key"`, `"token"`, `"password"`, `"secret"`, `"credential"` (case-insensitive) — asserted by unit test
- [ ] Import path `from forge.fleet.manifest import FORGE_MANIFEST` resolves

## Seam Note

This task is a **producer** for Integration Contract FORGE_MANIFEST (§4):
- Consumer: TASK-NFI-004 (fleet_publisher.register_on_boot)
- Format: `nats_core.manifest.AgentManifest` (immutable module-level constant)

## Implementation Notes

- Pure declarative — no runtime I/O, no env reads
- Version string `"0.1.0"` sourced from `forge.__version__` or hardcoded if not yet available
- The secret-free unit test is cheap; include it here rather than deferring to TASK-NFI-010
