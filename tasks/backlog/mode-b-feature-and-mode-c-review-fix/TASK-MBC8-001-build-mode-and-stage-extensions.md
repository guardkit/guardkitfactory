# Task: Add BuildMode enum and extend StageClass with TASK_REVIEW + TASK_WORK

## Description

Introduce the `BuildMode` enum (`MODE_A`, `MODE_B`, `MODE_C`) so the Supervisor
can dispatch by chain shape, and extend the canonical stage taxonomy with the
two Mode C stage classes (`/task-review` and `/task-work`). Persist `mode` on
the `Build` row so crash recovery and the queue picker can route correctly
without re-deriving it.

This is declarative groundwork for Wave 2's planners. It must not change Mode A
behaviour: existing builds default to `MODE_A` on read.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `forge.lifecycle.identifiers` (or a new `forge.lifecycle.modes`) exports
      `BuildMode(StrEnum)` with members `MODE_A = "mode-a"`,
      `MODE_B = "mode-b"`, `MODE_C = "mode-c"`
- [ ] `forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy` extends `StageClass` with new members
      `TASK_REVIEW = "task-review"` and `TASK_WORK = "task-work"` placed at the
      end of the enum so existing Mode A iteration order is preserved
- [ ] `STAGE_PREREQUISITES` adds `TASK_WORK ← TASK_REVIEW` (single entry; the
      per-fix-task fan-out is enforced by `ModeCCyclePlanner` in TASK-MBC8-004)
- [ ] `PER_FEATURE_STAGES` is unchanged; new `PER_FIX_TASK_STAGES` frozenset
      contains `TASK_WORK`
- [ ] `Build` model in `forge.lifecycle.persistence` gains `mode: BuildMode`
      with default `MODE_A`; `BuildRow` mirrors the column
- [ ] SQLite migration adds `mode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'mode-a'` to `builds`
      table; backfill is the default literal so historical rows stay valid
- [ ] `SqliteLifecyclePersistence.queue_build` accepts `mode: BuildMode` and
      writes it; `BuildStatusView` exposes `mode` for the CLI status command
- [ ] All existing Mode A tests still pass without modification
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with zero
      errors

## Implementation Notes

`BuildMode` lives next to `Build` rather than `StageClass` because the mode is
a property of the build, not the stage. Importing `BuildMode` from a lifecycle
module keeps `stage_taxonomy.py` import-cycle-free.

The `TASK_REVIEW` / `TASK_WORK` extension to `StageClass` deliberately appends
to the end so Mode A's iteration-order contract (used by `StageOrderingGuard`
in TASK-MAG7-003) is preserved. Mode-specific iteration order is the planners'
responsibility, not the enum's.

Migration must be additive only — no data loss, no rename. Existing rows
backfill to `mode-a` so the substrate keeps working for any in-flight Mode A
build during the upgrade window.
