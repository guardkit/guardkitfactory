# Task: Cross-mode concurrency integration tests (Mode A + B + C in flight together)

## Description

Group K's three-way mode interleave is the strongest concurrency assertion
in FEAT-FORGE-008: one Mode A build, one Mode B build, and one Mode C build
all in flight at the same time, holding isolated approval channels and
isolated stage chains. This task implements that integration test plus the
two-way Mode B/B and Mode B/C concurrency scenarios from Group F.

These tests pin down the supervisor's async-safety guarantee — the same
substrate that backed FEAT-FORGE-007's per-feature concurrency must hold
across modes (the supervisor is the only shared component).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `tests/integration/test_cross_mode_concurrency.py` covers:
  - [ ] **Two Mode B builds** running simultaneously: each gets its own
        autobuild task ID; each pauses at its own flagged-for-review
        checkpoint; an approval response targeting build 1 resolves only
        build 1 (Group F)
  - [ ] **Mode B + Mode C concurrent**: Mode B at autobuild, Mode C at
        task-work; both pause at flagged-for-review; approvals route by
        build identifier (Group F)
  - [ ] **Three-way interleave (Mode A + B + C)**: each build's recorded
        stage history reflects only its mode's stages; no cross-talk
        between approval channels (Group K)
  - [ ] **Supervisor responsiveness during async stages**: while Build 1's
        autobuild or task-work is in the running lifecycle, Build 2's first
        stage is dispatched without waiting (Group F "supervisor dispatches
        second build's stage during first build's async stage")
- [ ] **Idempotent first-wins under concurrency** (Group I):
  - [ ] Two simultaneous approval responses for the same paused stage with
        different decisions resolve under exactly one decision
  - [ ] No second resume is applied for the duplicate response
  - [ ] Recorded resume event count is exactly 1
- [ ] **Calibration-priors snapshot stability** (Group I, ASSUM-012):
  - [ ] Capture a calibration-priors snapshot at the start of a Mode B
        build
  - [ ] Mutate the operator's calibration history mid-build
  - [ ] Assert later stages of the in-flight build still see the snapshot
        captured at start
- [ ] **Notification publish failure isolation** (Group G):
  - [ ] A stage approval is recorded
  - [ ] The outbound NATS publish for that approval fails
  - [ ] The stage is still recorded as approved on the build's history; the
        next stage's prerequisite still evaluates as satisfied
- [ ] Tests run in under 60 seconds; concurrency uses `asyncio.gather`
      against an in-memory NATS adapter
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with zero
      errors

## Implementation Notes

Reuse `Supervisor` as a single instance across all builds in the test —
that is the contract the production supervisor satisfies. Multiple
`Supervisor` instances would mask the async-safety assertion.

The Group K three-way test is the strongest integration assertion in the
feature; if it passes, the substrate is reliably mode-agnostic. If it
fails, the failure mode points to the exact shared component (supervisor,
NATS adapter, or persistence layer).
