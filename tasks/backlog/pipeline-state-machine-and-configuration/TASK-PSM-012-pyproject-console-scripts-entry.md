      block to pyproject.toml with `forge = "forge.cli.main:main"` so `pip install
      -e .` writes a `forge` shim onto $PATH; (2) registered the previously-orphaned
      `status_cmd` from `forge.cli.status` on the top-level Click group in `src/forge/cli/main.py`
      so all five subcommands (queue, status, history, cancel, skip) appear under
      `forge --help`. The status command was already implemented by TASK-PSM-009 but
      had never been wired in'

# Task: pyproject.toml `console_scripts` entry for forge CLI

## Description

Add the Click entry point to [pyproject.toml](../../../pyproject.toml) so
`pip install` (or `pip install -e .`) makes the `forge` binary available
on PATH:

```toml
[project.scripts]
forge = "forge.cli.main:main"
```

After this is wired:

- `forge --help` lists subcommands (queue, status, history, cancel, skip)
- `forge queue --help` shows the queue subcommand options
- `pyinstrument` / `cProfile` show the binary launching cleanly with no
  import-time NATS connection (read commands MUST start without touching
  the bus)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pyproject.toml` contains `[project.scripts]` section with the
      `forge = "forge.cli.main:main"` entry
- [ ] `pip install -e .` (or the project's equivalent) succeeds
- [ ] `forge --help` runs and exits 0; output lists all five subcommands
- [ ] `forge queue --help`, `forge status --help`, `forge history --help`,
      `forge cancel --help`, `forge skip --help` all exit 0
- [ ] Smoke test: `forge status` against an empty SQLite DB returns an
      empty table (no NATS connection attempted — verified by tracing)
- [ ] `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` are NOT used (this is a `pyproject.toml`
      project per the existing convention)
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with
      zero errors

## Implementation Notes

This is the smallest task in the feature but the most user-visible — it's
what makes the CLI exist as a binary. Sequence after Wave 4 finishes so
all five subcommands are wireable.

## Coach Validation

- `pyproject.toml` has the `[project.scripts]` block
- `forge` is on PATH after `pip install -e .`
- `forge --help` exits 0 and shows all five subcommands
- No NATS connection during `forge --help` startup
