# Task: Define StageClass enum and stage prerequisite map

## Description

Define the eight Mode A stage classes as a Python `StrEnum` and a prerequisite
map that encodes the seven prerequisite rows from FEAT-FORGE-007 Group B
Scenario Outline ("A downstream stage is not dispatched before its prerequisite
has reached the approved state").

This is the canonical taxonomy that every guard, dispatcher, and context
builder downstream relies on. It must match the feature spec verbatim.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy` module exists at
      `src/forge/pipeline/stage_taxonomy.py`
- [ ] Exports `StageClass(StrEnum)` with members in order:
      `PRODUCT_OWNER`, `ARCHITECT`, `SYSTEM_ARCH`, `SYSTEM_DESIGN`,
      `FEATURE_SPEC`, `FEATURE_PLAN`, `AUTOBUILD`, `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`
- [ ] Exports `STAGE_PREREQUISITES: dict[StageClass, list[StageClass]]` with
      exactly seven entries matching the Group B Scenario Outline:
      `architect ← product-owner`, `system-arch ← architect`,
      `system-design ← system-arch`, `feature-spec ← system-design`,
      `feature-plan ← feature-spec` (per feature),
      `autobuild ← feature-plan` (per feature),
      `pull-request ← autobuild for every feature`
- [ ] Exports `CONSTITUTIONAL_STAGES: frozenset[StageClass]` containing
      `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`
- [ ] Exports `PER_FEATURE_STAGES: frozenset[StageClass]` containing
      `FEATURE_SPEC`, `FEATURE_PLAN`, `AUTOBUILD`, `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW`
- [ ] Module docstring references FEAT-FORGE-007 ASSUM-001 and
      ADR-ARCH-026 (constitutional rule)
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with
      zero errors

## Implementation Notes

This is a declarative module with no runtime behaviour beyond providing the
taxonomy. Keep it free of imports from any other `forge.pipeline` module so it
can be imported by all downstream tasks in Waves 2–4 without a cycle.

The eight stage names map onto the
`features/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end.feature`
Background and key-example scenarios. Do not rename them.
