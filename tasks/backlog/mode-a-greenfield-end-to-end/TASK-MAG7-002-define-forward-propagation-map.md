# Task: Define forward-propagation contract map

## Description

Define the producer-to-consumer artefact handshake for each of the seven
non-product-owner stages. This is what tells the
`ForwardContextBuilder` (TASK-MAG7-006) which `stage_log` artefact_path values
to thread into the next stage's `--context` flags.

Encodes Group A scenarios: "The product-owner output is supplied as input to
the architect delegation" and "Architecture outputs are supplied as context for
system design".

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `forge.pipeline.forward_propagation` module exists at
      `src/forge/pipeline/forward_propagation.py`
- [ ] Exports `ContextRecipe` Pydantic model with fields:
      `producer_stage: StageClass`, `artefact_kind: Literal["text", "path", "path-list"]`,
      `context_flag: str` (e.g. `--context`), `description: str`
- [ ] Exports `PROPAGATION_CONTRACT: dict[StageClass, ContextRecipe]` with
      exactly seven entries, one per non-product-owner stage:
      - `ARCHITECT` ← product-owner approved charter (text)
      - `SYSTEM_ARCH` ← architect approved output (text)
      - `SYSTEM_DESIGN` ← system-arch artefact paths (path-list)
      - `FEATURE_SPEC` ← system-design feature catalogue entry (text)
      - `FEATURE_PLAN` ← feature-spec artefact path (path)
      - `AUTOBUILD` ← feature-plan artefact path (path)
      - `PULL_REQUEST_REVIEW` ← autobuild branch ref + commit summary (text)
- [ ] Module passes a self-validation check at import: every key is reachable
      from `PRODUCT_OWNER` via the `STAGE_PREREQUISITES` chain from
      TASK-MAG7-001
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with
      zero errors

## Implementation Notes

The seven entries mirror the seven prerequisite rows from TASK-MAG7-001 — by
construction every approved-prerequisite produces an artefact that is consumed
by the immediate-downstream stage.

This module imports from `forge.pipeline.stage_taxonomy` (TASK-MAG7-001) but
nothing else from `forge.pipeline.*`. Keep it side-effect free so test modules
can import it without bringing up the substrate.
