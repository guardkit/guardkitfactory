# Task: Smoke test — minimal greenfield brief to PR-awaiting-review

## Description

End-to-end smoke test that drives a one-line product brief through every
Mode A stage with auto-approval at every flagged-for-review checkpoint, and
asserts the build terminates paused at pull-request review awaiting human
approval with a recorded PR URL.

Covers Group H @smoke @integration scenarios:
- "A minimal greenfield brief drives a single-feature run to a pull request
  awaiting human review"
- "A greenfield build with no available specialists is flagged for review
  at every specialist stage" (degraded path)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test module exists at
      `tests/integration/test_mode_a_smoke.py`
- [ ] Test fixture `greenfield_brief_pipeline` brings up: a fake
      specialist registry pre-populated with healthy product-owner +
      architect specialists, a fake GuardKit subprocess engine returning
      canned approved artefacts, an in-memory SQLite, and a stub approval
      channel that auto-approves
- [ ] Smoke test: queue one-line brief, drive supervisor turns until
      terminal, assert build is paused at PR-review with mandatory_human
      gate mode, PR URL recorded in `stage_log`
- [ ] Smoke test asserts `stage_log` contains the eight-stage chain in
      canonical order (Group G @data-integrity scenario covered as part
      of smoke)
- [ ] Degraded test: same harness with empty specialist registry; assert
      build is flagged for review at product-owner stage with degraded
      rationale, no architect dispatch occurred
- [ ] Tests use the existing `FakeClock` pattern from
      `src/forge/pipeline.py` for deterministic timing
- [ ] All modified files pass project-configured lint/format checks with
      zero errors

## Implementation Notes

This is the headline smoke for FEAT-FORGE-007 — it asserts that the
composition works end-to-end. Keep the harness small: real substrate
adapters (FEAT-FORGE-001 SQLite, FEAT-FORGE-005 subprocess engine) are
mocked at their Protocol boundaries; only the FEAT-FORGE-007 net-new code
runs for real.

The auto-approval-at-every-checkpoint is the canary — if any
non-constitutional gate fails to auto-approve under high Coach scores, the
smoke fails and identifies the gate decision that diverged.
