Review complete. Task moved to tasks/completed/TASK-REV-C3E7/.

Summary
TASK-REV-C3E7 — [I]mplemented

Report: .claude/reviews/TASK-REV-C3E7-review-report.md
Score: 75/100 (pre-merge gate inventory thin; 6 blockers for /system-arch now addressed)
What was done
Phase 1a — D90D verification: 7/8 findings resolved by prior FEAT-FVDA v2.2 commit. F4 (coverage figure) auto-resolved by 17 low-risk citation edits across 5 docs.

Phases 2–4 — Lessons gap analysis: 14 parity gaps surfaced from specialist-agent LES1 (6 BLOCKERS, 5 MEDIUM, 3 LOW) with full dispositions across 6 parity surfaces, 9 evidence pointers, and 22 checklist items.

9 surgical edits applied to primary docs (all anchor v2.2 preserved, purely additive):

forge-build-plan.md: 6 operations covering G1/G3/G4/G6/G7/G8/G10/G11/G12/G13/G14 — new provisioning prereq wording, ADR commit-annotation convention, [providers] extras rule, .env.example + deferred Dockerfile rows, new "LES1 Parity Gates" subsection (CMDW/PORT/ARFS/canonical-freeze), orphan-container + CLI-redaction risks
forge-pipeline-orchestrator-refresh.md: 3 operations covering G2/G5/G9 — reply-subject convention paragraph, provider-at-factory rule, fire-and-forget tool annotations + new forge_cancel manifest entry
fleet-master-index.md: no gap edits required (structurally aligned)
Files changed
6 modified, 2 deleted (D90D F5 stale tasks), 2 created (review report + completed task folder). Zero new docs/ files created.

Forge ideas docs are now ready for /system-arch consumption with specialist-agent LES1 parity gates baked in as pre-merge requirements.

685 total episodes in Graphiti (was 585 → +100 episodes added)
2 warnings for ADR-012 + ADR-022 ("Missing required section: Status") — non-blocking, episodes still ingested; the parser expects ## Status as a section heading rather than the - **Status:** Accepted inline-bullet format I used. Follow-up: I can re-format those two files to use the heading-style Status section if you want the warnings cleared. Not urgent.

Headline architectural position (Forge, one sentence)
"A DeepAgents-native reasoning orchestrator whose behaviour is entirely emergent from (a) live fleet capabilities discovered via AgentManifests, (b) retrieved priors from Rich's calibration corpus in Graphiti, and (c) constitutional safety rules in forge.yaml — with zero pre-coded pipeline stages, gate thresholds, or role-specific dispatch."

This is what 9 revisions of Category-level pushback produced — and the result is materially different from a conventional state-machine orchestrator. The agent harness earns its keep.

Suggested next steps
Review — open ARCHITECTURE.md and spot-check the module map + ADR index against the session's conclusions. The docs are in your working tree now.
Next command — /system-design "Forge" (Phase 2 of the upstream pipeline) to produce detailed tool contracts, NATS payload schemas beyond what nats-core already has, and the forge.yaml configuration schema.
Optional polish — if the ADR-012/ADR-022 Status-section warnings bother you, reformat those two ADRs to use heading style (## Status) and re-seed with guardkit graphiti add-context … --force. Cosmetic only.
Follow-on work (not for this session) — ADR-ARCH-025 mentioned a @forge_tool base decorator to enforce the "tools never raise" policy; that becomes a design point in /system-design.


/task-create please create a reivew task to implement these findings:
# TASK-REV-ARCH-POLISH — /system-arch artefact polish before /system-design

**Origin:** External review of forge/docs/architecture/ completed 2026-04-19.
**Scope:** Paperwork + two verifications. No structural changes to ADRs.
**Estimated effort:** 30-45 minutes

## In scope

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md §13 Decision Index** — add ADR-031 row, bump header
   count from 30 to 31. (Already tracked as TASK-DOC-B2A4 — fold in or
   merge.)

2. **ADR-012 and ADR-022 Status section format** — reformat from inline
   bullet `- **Status:** Accepted` to heading style `## Status\n\nAccepted`
   to match the parser expectation noted in command-history.md. Re-run
   `guardkit graphiti add-context --force` for these two after editing.

3. **ARCHITECTURE.md §3 module count** — recount the module list; reconcile
   "15 modules" header with the prose (current count appears to be 16+
   depending on how guardkit_* is grouped). Either fix the number or
   restructure the groupings so the count is accurate.

4. **ADR-012 (No MCP interface) content review** — given ADR-031 added
   async subagent supervisor tools (`list_async_tasks` etc.), confirm
   ADR-012's reasoning for rejecting MCP still holds and is not subtly
   undermined by the async-subagent observability surface. One read;
   either append a one-line note confirming, or flag for discussion.

5. **Spike: DeepAgents 0.5.3 primitives (ASSUM-008 + ASSUM-009)** —
   before /system-design, run a 1-2 hour verification:
   - Confirm DeepAgents permissions system actually refuses writes
     outside the allow_write allowlist (not just documented behaviour).
   - Confirm LangGraph `interrupt()` survives external resume with typed
     Pydantic payload round-trip (write a minimal two-file repro).
   - Capture findings in docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md
   - If either fails, ADR-021 and ADR-023 need a revision before /system-design.

## Out of scope

- Any reopening of ADR-016, ADR-019, ADR-023 thesis. These are settled.
- Restructuring the module map or C4 diagrams.
- Compressing ADR-031 from 135 → 60-80 lines (deferred per TASK-REV-C7D1).
- Full ADR-by-ADR read of the 18 ADRs not covered in external review
  (003, 004, 009, 013, 014, 017, 018, 024, 027-030). Optional follow-up
  if confidence wanted before /system-plan.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md §13 lists 31 ADRs
- [ ] ADR-012 and ADR-022 reformatted; Graphiti re-ingestion clean
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md §3 module count matches the prose list
- [ ] ADR-012 reviewed post-ADR-031; one-line note added or flag raised
- [ ] deepagents-053-verification.md committed; findings summarised
- [ ] No new ADRs created by this task (if verification fails, separate
      revision task spawned)

## Not doing / decisions captured

- Residual session drift: none found requiring ADR-level revision.
- Course-correction arc: documented in ARCHITECTURE.md + ADR Context
  sections; no further archaeology needed.

/task-review TASK-REV-A7D3

Review task A7D3

All §1–§4 edits are present in commit 7bcc7da. Working tree now only has the archival move for TASK-DOC-B2A4 + TASK-REV-A7D3 metadata update + the review report — ready for checkpoint.

Phase 5: Decision Checkpoint — TASK-REV-A7D3
Review Results (see full report: .claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md)

§1–§4 score: 100/100 (all acceptance criteria met verbatim)
§5 status: scoped-not-executed per agreed hybrid workflow
Findings: 7 · Recommendations: 5
What landed (already in commit 7bcc7da):

§1: ARCHITECTURE.md §13 — 30 ADRs→31 ADRs, ADR-031 row added
§2: ADR-012 and ADR-022 Status reformatted; Graphiti re-ingestion clean (exit 0, no Status-warning)
§3: ARCHITECTURE.md §3 header now reads "5 groups — 18 Python modules + 6 @tool-layer entries"
§4: ADR-012 reconfirmation note appended (reasoning holds; larger tool surface strengthens the MCP-rejection argument)
What's unstaged (waiting for commit at checkpoint close):

.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md — full review + §5 scoping
tasks/in_progress/TASK-REV-A7D3/ — frontmatter now status: in_progress + review_results block; Implementation Notes populated
tasks/backlog/TASK-DOC-B2A4/ → tasks/completed/TASK-DOC-B2A4/ — archived as superseded
Caveats:

AC-7 commit message: the task's AC-7 requires a commit message referencing both TASK-DOC-B2A4 and TASK-REV-A7D3. Commit 7bcc7da ("review and refinements of architecture") bundled §1–§4 with other in-flight work and does not reference either ID. The upcoming archival-move commit is the natural place to satisfy AC-7 — suggest message along the lines of docs/tasks: close TASK-REV-A7D3 §1–§4; archive TASK-DOC-B2A4 as superseded.
AC-5 deferred: docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md is not yet committed. Per option 3, §5 is scoping-only here; the spike needs a spawned TASK-SPIKE-* task.
Decision Options:

[A] Accept — Close review as-is. §1–§4 stand; §5 left for you to schedule separately. /system-design would be unblocked on §5 only when you run the spike manually.
[I] Implement — Accept §1–§4, archive TASK-DOC-B2A4, and create a TASK-SPIKE-* backlog task pre-populated from §5 of the review report. Also marks /system-design as blocked on that new task. Recommended.
[R] Revise — Re-run review at comprehensive depth (e.g. execute the spike inline). Not recommended — the task's Known Risks explicitly warn against spike scope creep from within this task.
[C] Cancel — Discard the review, revert §1–§4. Not recommended — the paperwork is a clean pass.
Which do you want? ([A] / [I] / [R] / [C])

TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md
I
[I]mplement chosen. Since only one follow-up task is needed, I'll skip Context B clarification and spawn TASK-SPIKE-* directly from §5 of the review report.

[I]mplement — Execution Plan
Spawned: TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 · complexity 5 · priority high · ~1–2 hours · blocks /system-design

The new spike task references the review report's §5 as its canonical scoping source, so no information is duplicated or at risk of divergence.

Task state transitions:

TASK-REV-A7D3 → in_review/, status review_complete, decision implement, spawned TASK-SPIKE-C1E9
TASK-DOC-B2A4 → completed/, status superseded, superseded_by: TASK-REV-A7D3
TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 → backlog/, status backlog, parent_review: TASK-REV-A7D3, blocks: [/system-design]

§1–§4 edits are already in commit 7bcc7da (landed mid-run).

Next Steps
Commit the review close-out (when you're ready). Suggested message to satisfy AC-7:

docs/tasks: close TASK-REV-A7D3 §1–§4; spawn TASK-SPIKE-C1E9; archive TASK-DOC-B2A4

- §1–§4 architecture polish already landed in 7bcc7da (Decision Index
  §13, ADR-012/-022 Status heading reformat, §3 module count, ADR-012
  post-ADR-031 reconfirmation).
- §5 verification spike scoped in review report, spawned as
  TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 in backlog; blocks /system-design.
- TASK-DOC-B2A4 archived as superseded by TASK-REV-A7D3.
Run TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 when you want to unblock /system-design. It's ~1–2 hours, fully scoped, and has a self-contained execution checklist in .claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md §5.
Do not run /system-design until TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 lands its findings file at docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md.

/task-work TASK-SPIKE-C1E9

TASK-SPIKE-D2F7 is done. Summary:

Verdict: FAIL on type fidelity, PASS on control flow. Under langgraph dev, pause + resume mechanics work end-to-end, but the node observes the resumed value as a plain dict — isinstance(..., ApprovalDecision) is False, nested Pydantic/UUID/datetime fields do not survive the HTTP/msgpack layer.

Next: /system-design remains blocked on TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3, not on this spike.

/task-review TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3


Review Report: TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3
Mode: decision (task carries decision_required: true)
Depth: standard
Scope: choose between Option A / B / C for ADR-ARCH-021 revision, and confirm the ADR edits the revision must carry.

Situation recap
D2F7 established that under langgraph dev (the canonical Forge deployment per ADR-021 itself), interrupt()'s return value is a plain dict, not the typed ApprovalResponsePayload the ADR's code snippet assumes. Control-flow is fine; type fidelity is not. The ADR's snippet is wrong-as-written and must be revised before /system-design proceeds.

Option evaluation
Criterion	A: explicit rehydrate	B: allowed_msgpack_modules	C: Hybrid (A now, B later)
Unblocks /system-design today	✅	❌ (needs re-spike)	✅
New infra	None	Serde registration module	None now
Call-site burden	Every site rehydrates (helper mitigates)	Zero (transparent)	Rehydrates now; transparent later if B works
Verification cost	Minimal — direct code	Unknown — spike required	Minimal now; spike deferred
Risk of silent drift	Medium (drift between call sites)	Low (one config)	Medium near-term, low long-term
Failure-mode if hypothesis wrong	N/A — mechanism is explicit	High — HTTP/JSON layer may not honour allowed_msgpack_modules; msgpack warning is about checkpoint layer, not HTTP transport	Protected — A remains load-bearing regardless
Key risk flag on Option B — the D2F7 warning cited in the task (allowed_msgpack_modules) is emitted by LangGraph's checkpoint deserialization. The server-mode FAIL is driven by an HTTP/JSON transport layer that sits above the checkpoint. allowed_msgpack_modules may or may not carry typing across the HTTP wire; it's a hypothesis, not a known fix. Committing Option B to the ADR without a spike would move an unverified assumption back into the decision we just finished removing.

Recommendation: Option C (hybrid)
Near-term (this ADR revision): mandate explicit rehydration at the call site via a small helper, e.g.:


def resume_value_as(model_cls, raw):
    return raw if isinstance(raw, model_cls) else model_cls.model_validate(raw)

raw = interrupt({...})
response = resume_value_as(ApprovalResponsePayload, raw)
return handle_approval_response(response, build_id)
The isinstance short-circuit means the helper is forward-compatible if Option B later succeeds — no code change needed at call sites.

Long-term (separate follow-up task, non-blocking on /system-design): spike allowed_msgpack_modules under server mode and see whether it rehydrates across HTTP. If yes: register types in the live graph config and keep the helper as belt-and-braces. If no: we stop there, A is sufficient.

Required ADR edits (in scope for this task)
Revision header (Category-4-style, Revision 10), dated 2026-04-20, citing TASK-SPIKE-D2F7 and this task; note that server-mode returns dict and the ADR now mandates explicit rehydration.
Decision code block: replace response = interrupt({...}) + direct pass-through with the resume_value_as(ApprovalResponsePayload, interrupt({...})) form above. Show the helper's definition inline or point at its home module (see note below).
Consequences:
Strike the line "Resume with typed payload works natively — no custom resume RPC" (it's server-mode-false as written).
Add: call sites are responsible for rehydration via resume_value_as; rationale = HTTP/JSON transport in langgraph dev strips Pydantic typing; allowed_msgpack_modules as a serde-level fix is a separate, deferred investigation.
References: update the footer so it points at the D2F7 closeout section, not only the C1E9 section. The existing line already does most of this — verify it matches Revision-10 wording.
Where does resume_value_as live? Not in scope to land the code here (that's /system-design's job) but the ADR should name the expected home — suggest forge.adapters.langgraph (next to the interrupt() call sites and NATS resume consumer). Recording this keeps /system-design from re-litigating it.
Acceptance-criteria alignment
AC from task file	Met by Option C?
Revision header on ADR	✅ — Revision 10 entry
Decision code block shows explicit rehydration	✅ — helper form
Consequences updated	✅ — see above
References points at D2F7 section	✅ — already partially there
Option B re-verification note OR follow-up task	✅ — scope follow-up spike task explicitly
/system-design unblocked	✅ — this revision is self-contained
Commit cites both task IDs	✅ — mechanical
Follow-up to scope explicitly
TASK-SPIKE-* (new) — verify whether registering Pydantic interrupt/resume types in LangGraph's allowed_msgpack_modules (or equivalent serde hook) causes server-mode resume values to arrive as typed instances, matching the direct-invoke row table in D2F7. Non-blocking on /system-design; pure optimisation. If it passes, the resume_value_as helper becomes defensive-only.

Risks / watch-outs reconfirmed
Helper must live in one place — resist the temptation to inline at each call site (drift risk called out in the task).
Don't touch ADR-022 or ADR-023 — tight scope.
If /system-design decides to use a different interrupt-payload module layout, the helper location might need to move; note this in the ADR's "Consequences" to pre-empt churn.
Decision Checkpoint
Review verdict: Option C (Hybrid) recommended. ADR edits are well-scoped; unblocks /system-design without smuggling an unverified hypothesis back into the decision.

Options:

[A]ccept — approve Option C, mark review complete. You then run /task-work TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3 (or edit the ADR directly — complexity 3, no subtasks needed) and scope the follow-up spike as a separate task.
[R]evise — push back: you want me to go deeper on Option B's feasibility (e.g. actually spike allowed_msgpack_modules now instead of deferring), or want a different recommendation.
[I]mplement — auto-generate the ADR-edit subtask + the deferred-spike follow-up task. Overkill for a 1–2 hour ADR edit but offered for completeness.
[C]ancel — discard.
Your choice?

A


/task-work TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3
This is a complexity-3, documentation-only, pre-reviewed ADR edit with explicit guidance already in the task file. Per the command spec's auto-detection rules (parent_review + complexity ≤4 → minimal) and the documentation-only micro-task exception, this runs in minimal intensity. No tests, no specialist implementation agent — the edit is a markdown revision and I'll do it directly and verify.

Let me check sibling ADRs for the revision-header convention, then move the task to in_progress.

    docs(adr-021): Revision 10 — server-mode interrupt rehydration (Option C)
    
    ADR-ARCH-021 Revision 10 lands Option C (hybrid) per TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3,
    citing the server-mode FAIL evidence from TASK-SPIKE-D2F7:
    
    - Decision prose + code block rewritten to state that `langgraph dev` /
      LangGraph server returns `dict` from `interrupt()`, not a typed Pydantic
      instance. Every call site MUST rehydrate via `resume_value_as(model_cls,
      raw)` (with isinstance short-circuit for forward-compat with a future
      serde fix). Helper home named as `forge.adapters.langgraph`; helper
      implementation deferred to `/system-design` — no code lands here.
    - Consequences updated; old "+ Resume with typed payload works natively"
      bullet explicitly struck (kept legible under a "Struck by Revision 10"
      subsection).
    - New "Revision 10" section records trigger, chosen option, not-A-alone /
      not-B-alone reasoning, and the deferred non-blocking Option B spike
      (register types via `allowed_msgpack_modules` / serde hook, re-verify
      row-for-row parity with D2F7).
    - References extended to cite both C1E9 and D2F7 sections plus this task.
    
    Also appends a "Resolution" subsection to the verification doc under the
    server-mode closeout, recording the Option C decision, helper contract,
    deferred Option B spike, and the `/system-design` unblock. Server-mode
    rows are not re-run in this revision — parity with direct-invoke rows
    becomes the success criterion of the deferred spike.

The task is already in_review (commit 0a40b25, 2026-04-20), the ADR carries Revision 10 with exactly the Option C shape the review approved, and the verification doc has the resolution appendage.

/task-work Summary — TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3
Nothing to do. All acceptance criteria are already met by commit 0a40b25.

AC	Status	Evidence
Revision header on ADR	✅	ADR-021:3-6, §Revision 10
Decision code block rehydrates explicitly	✅	resume_value_as helper + call-site use
Consequences updated	✅	New rehydration line at :79; "typed payload works natively" struck at :84-88
References → D2F7 section	✅	:147-149
Option B re-verification scoped as explicit follow-up	✅	§Revision 10 — Deferred follow-up
/system-design unblocked	✅	Stated at :136-137
Commit cites both task IDs	✅	Commit 0a40b25 body references TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3 and TASK-SPIKE-D2F7
Task moved to IN_REVIEW	✅	tasks/in_review/TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3/
State: task is in in_review, tree is clean, on main, up to date with origin/main.

Next step (yours, not mine to take without asking): run /task-complete TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3 to archive it, then /system-design is free to start. The deferred Option B spike still needs to be scoped as a separate TASK-SPIKE-* at your discretion — non-blocking.

No code changed, no new commits made — nothing was needed.

✅ Task Complete: TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3
State: IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED
Completed: 2026-04-23
Location: tasks/completed/TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3/
Implementation commit: 0a40b25 (ADR Revision 10)
Completion commit: 79589c5

Acceptance criteria: all 7 met (verified in prior turn — ADR Revision 10 header, rewritten Decision block with resume_value_as, Consequences update with struck line, References → D2F7, deferred follow-up scoped, /system-design unblocked, commit cites both task IDs).

Graphiti capture: queued to guardkit__task_outcomes (outcome + lessons) and guardkit__project_decisions (Option C rationale including the Option-B-is-unverified reasoning, for future surfacing).

Unblocks: /system-design is now free to start.
Still outstanding (your call, not mine to spawn): the deferred Option B spike (TASK-SPIKE-*) — non-blocking; pure optimisation; only worth scoping if the HTTP/JSON serde hypothesis turns out to matter to you.

Tree is clean.

implement TASK-SPIKE-D2F7

TASK-SPIKE-D2F7 is done. Summary:

Verdict: FAIL on type fidelity, PASS on control flow. Under langgraph dev, pause + resume mechanics work end-to-end, but the node observes the resumed value as a plain dict — isinstance(..., ApprovalDecision) is False, nested Pydantic/UUID/datetime fields do not survive the HTTP/msgpack layer.

What changed:

spikes/deepagents-053/langgraph.json + module-level graph export on interrupt_graph.py:134
New driver spikes/deepagents-053/interrupt_server_drive.py
Full row-for-row comparison in deepagents-053-verification.md §Server-mode closeout
ADR-ARCH-021 References line flags the FAIL + links the revision task
New backlog task TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3 with three option paths (A: explicit .model_validate; B: allowed_msgpack_modules; C: hybrid)
D2F7 moved to in_review with Implementation Notes populated
Committed as f387ca6
Next: /system-design remains blocked on TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3, not on this spike.

/task-work TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3

I've loaded the ADR and verification doc. This task requires a decision between Options A/B/C before I can revise the ADR.

Recommendation: Option C (hybrid)

Option A (explicit rehydration at call site): response = ApprovalResponsePayload.model_validate(interrupt({...})) — cheap, no new infra, but every call site must remember.
Option B (allowed_msgpack_modules registration): robust auto-rehydration, but requires a fresh spike to verify server-mode parity — extra cost, and payload types aren't finalized until /system-design.
Option C (hybrid): A now, B as follow-up once /system-design finalizes payload types.
Option C matches the task's framing and avoids gating the revision (and /system-design) on a fresh spike. It also lets me add a resume_value_as(model_cls, raw) helper in the same revision to prevent copy-paste drift (a risk flagged in the task).

Which option do you want — A, B, or C? (If C, should I include the resume_value_as helper in scope, or keep the ADR strictly to the contract and leave the helper for /system-design?)

TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3-server-mode-interrupt-hydration.md
proceed with Option C include the helper

Task complete and moved to IN_REVIEW. Summary:

ADR-ARCH-021 Revision 10 lands Option C (hybrid) with the resume_value_as helper:

Header updated to "Accepted (Revision 10, 2026-04-20)"
Decision prose + code block rewritten: server-mode interrupt() returns dict; call sites MUST rehydrate via resume_value_as(model_cls, raw) (with isinstance short-circuit for forward-compat). Helper home named as forge.adapters.langgraph; implementation deferred to /system-design.
Consequences updated; old "Resume with typed payload works natively" bullet explicitly struck.
New "Revision 10" section with trigger, chosen option, not-A-alone / not-B-alone reasoning, and the deferred non-blocking Option B spike.
References extended to cite both C1E9 and D2F7 sections plus this task.
Verification doc gets a "Resolution" subsection under the server-mode closeout recording the decision, helper contract, deferred spike, and /system-design unblock.

Task file moved to tasks/in_review/; ACs 1–3 ticked; AC-4 (commit message) deferred to the commit step.

Quality gates: N/A (doc-only task, test_results.status: not_applicable). No code landed, no spike re-run, ADR-022/ADR-023 untouched — all per the review-outcome guardrails.

Want me to commit now (referencing both TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-E7B3 and TASK-SPIKE-D2F7 per AC-4), or do you want to review the ADR diff first?

I'll orient you on this task before spinning up the full review workflow — there's a framing question worth resolving first.

Task loaded: TASK-REV-A7D3-system-arch-artefact-polish.md

task_type: review, review_mode: architectural, review_depth: standard, complexity: 4
decision_required: false
Supersedes TASK-DOC-B2A4
Framing tension I want to flag before Phase 1:

This task is tagged task_type: review, but its Acceptance Criteria are execution items — §1-§4 are doc edits (Decision Index row, Status-heading reformat, module recount, ADR-012 post-ADR-031 note) and §5 is a 1-2 hour verification spike producing deepagents-053-verification.md. /task-review terminates in a review report + [A]ccept/[R]evise/[I]mplement checkpoint — it does not mutate ADRs or run spikes.

Three ways to run this, briefly:

Run as pure /task-review → I analyze the 5 scope items, produce a readiness/risk report with recommendations, and at Phase 5 checkpoint you'd pick [I]mplement, which would spawn subtasks for actual execution. Fits the command literally. Adds one hop before any real edits land.

Switch to /task-work TASK-REV-A7D3 → I execute §1-§4 doc edits directly, run §5 spike, commit per §7 commit discipline. Fits the acceptance criteria literally. But the command name is wrong for the review task_type.

Hybrid: scoped /task-review + inline execution of §1-§4 → Review each of the 4 paperwork items, execute them (they're mechanical), then produce a dedicated scoping/risk report for §5 spike only (since that's the actual uncertainty-bearing work). /task-review gates the spike; paperwork lands without waiting.

My read: option 3 matches the task's actual shape — §1-§4 are zero-judgment paperwork, and the real "review" value is scoping §5 before committing to DeepAgents 0.5.3 repros. But option 1 is the safest literal interpretation.

Which do you want? (Or if you'd prefer I just start clarification-questioner with Context A as the command spec describes, say so.)

# Review Report: TASK-REV-A7D3

**Task**: `/system-arch` artefact polish before `/system-design` (supersedes TASK-DOC-B2A4)
**Mode**: architectural · **Depth**: standard · **Date**: 2026-04-19
**Reviewer**: `/task-review` (architectural-review agent-equivalent, Opus reasoning)
**Workflow**: Hybrid — inline execution of §1–§4 paperwork + scoping report for §5 spike
**Related**: [TASK-REV-F1B8](../../tasks/in_review/TASK-REV-F1B8/) (parent review), [TASK-DOC-B2A4](../../tasks/backlog/TASK-DOC-B2A4/) (superseded)

---

## Executive Summary

Four of the five scope items (§1–§4) are **paperwork polish** — mechanical, zero-judgment doc edits gated only by consistency. They have been **executed inline** during this review. All acceptance criteria for §1–§4 are met; re-ingestion through the Graphiti parser completes without the "Missing required section: Status" warning that motivated §2.

Item §5 is a **1–2 hour verification spike** against DeepAgents 0.5.3 primitives (ASSUM-008 permissions, ASSUM-009 `interrupt()` round-trip). The spike is the only load-bearing item in the scope — a failure on either primitive invalidates ADR-ARCH-021 and/or ADR-ARCH-023 and blocks `/system-design`. This report **scopes** the spike (objectives, repro designs, success criteria, risk register, follow-up triggers) so it can be executed as a discrete next session without re-deriving the framing.

**Disposition recommendation: [I]mplement** — accept §1–§4 as complete, close this review, and spawn a single follow-up task (`TASK-SPIKE-*`) for the §5 verification work. Spawning as a separate task preserves commit discipline (§1–§4 can be reverted independently) and keeps the spike's scope-creep risk bounded.

**§1–§4 score**: 100/100 (acceptance criteria met verbatim).
**§5 readiness**: Ready to execute. Risk register populated; no pre-work blockers.

## §1–§4: Execution Results

### §1 — ARCHITECTURE.md §13 Decision Index

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| "30 ADRs" → "31 ADRs" prose count updated | ✅ [ARCHITECTURE.md:208](../../docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#L208) |
| ADR-031 row appended after ADR-030 | ✅ [ARCHITECTURE.md:242](../../docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#L242) |
| Category = "Implementation substrate" (matches ADR-020) | ✅ |
| Row title verbatim from TASK-DOC-B2A4 suggested shape | ✅ "Async subagents for long-running work; sync \`task()\` for bounded delegation" |
| No other diffs to §13 | ✅ |

Acceptance Criteria (task AC-1): **met**.

### §2 — ADR-012 and ADR-022 Status heading reformat

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| ADR-012: inline bullet → `## Status\n\nAccepted` | ✅ [ADR-ARCH-012:3-5](../../docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-012-no-mcp-interface.md#L3-5) |
| ADR-022: inline bullet → `## Status\n\nAccepted` | ✅ [ADR-ARCH-022:3-5](../../docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-022-dual-agent-memory.md#L3-5) |
| Date and Session bullets preserved | ✅ (retained as metadata bullets after Status section) |
| `guardkit graphiti add-context --force` re-ingestion, ADR-012 | ✅ Exit 0, episode `adr_adr-arch-012-no-mcp-interface-for-forge` (nodes=11, edges=14, invalidated=0), no Status-warning |
| `guardkit graphiti add-context --force` re-ingestion, ADR-022 | ✅ Exit 0, episode `adr_adr-arch-022-dual-agent-memory-langgraph-memory-store-graphiti` (nodes=10, edges=11, invalidated=0), no Status-warning (one transient Gemini 503 retried cleanly) |

Acceptance Criteria (task AC-2): **met**.

**Note on parser behaviour**: the parser now accepts the heading-style Status section on both files. Other ADRs (including ADR-031) still use the inline-bullet format; the 2026-04-18 ingestion warnings were specific to these two. No follow-up fleet-wide reformat is implied by this result.

### §3 — ARCHITECTURE.md §3 module count

**Authoritative recount of bulleted entries in §3:**

| Group | Count | Entries |
|---|---|---|
| A. DeepAgents Shell | 3 | `forge.agent`, `forge.prompts`, `forge.subagents` |
| B. Domain Core (pure) | 7 | `forge.gating`, `forge.state_machine`, `forge.notifications`, `forge.learning`, `forge.calibration`, `forge.discovery`, `forge.history_labels` |
| C. Tool Layer (`@tool` functions) | 6 | `dispatch_by_capability`, `approval_tools`, `notification_tools`, `graphiti_tools`, `guardkit_*`, `history_tools` |
| D. Adapters | 5 | `forge.adapters.nats`, `…sqlite`, `…guardkit`, `…graphiti`, `…history_parser` |
| E. Cross-cutting | 3 | `forge.config`, `forge.cli`, `forge.fleet` |

- **Python modules** (A + B + D + E): **18**
- **Tool-layer entries** (C, explicitly `@tool` functions, not modules per the section header): **6**
- **Total bulleted entries**: 24

Original header "15 modules in 5 groups" did not match any defensible count. Updated to: **"5 groups — 18 Python modules + 6 `@tool`-layer entries"** ([ARCHITECTURE.md:37](../../docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md#L37)).

Rationale for the phrasing: Section C explicitly describes its entries as tool *functions*, not modules (lexically: `@tool(parse_docstring=True) functions — Forge-specific only`). Collapsing them into the Python-module count would miscount; listing them separately keeps the header honest while preserving the "5 groups" promise.

Acceptance Criteria (task AC-3): **met**.

### §4 — ADR-012 (No MCP interface) content review post-ADR-031

**Question**: Does ADR-031's addition of five async-supervisor tools (`start_async_task`, `check_async_task`, `update_async_task`, `cancel_async_task`, `list_async_tasks`) subtly undermine ADR-012's rejection of MCP?

**Analysis**: no — and in fact the reverse.

| ADR-012 argument | Post-ADR-031 status |
|---|---|
| MCP serialises full tool schema into every call's context window | Unchanged — ADR-031 adds 5 tools to the Forge tool inventory |
| Forge has ~17–20 tools; MCP overhead is catastrophic at 200–500-turn builds | **Strengthened** — inventory grows to ~22–25 tools post-ADR-031 |
| Forge has no human-interactive use case that Claude Desktop MCP serves | Unchanged — async observability is served via CLI (`forge status` / `forge history`) + NATS event stream + LangSmith traces (ADR-FLEET-001), *not* MCP |
| CLI + NATS cover all external interaction paths | Unchanged — the five supervisor tools are internal to the Forge supervisor graph, not exposed externally |

**Decision (per task decision tree)**: reasoning holds → appended a reconfirmation note to ADR-012's Context section. [ADR-ARCH-012:13](../../docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-012-no-mcp-interface.md#L13).

The note explicitly names the five tools and cites the three observability paths (CLI, NATS event stream, LangSmith) so a future reader doesn't have to redo this analysis.

Acceptance Criteria (task AC-4): **met**.

---

## §5: Verification Spike — Scoping

Per the agreed hybrid workflow, §5 is **scoped here**, not executed. It should be executed as a discrete task (recommended: `TASK-SPIKE-*`) before `/system-design` runs. This section captures the framing, repro designs, risk register, and success criteria so the spike can start without re-deriving context.

### Spike objective

Verify that two DeepAgents 0.5.3 / LangGraph primitives behave at runtime as their backing ADRs assume:

- **ASSUM-008** (backs ADR-ARCH-023): the DeepAgents permissions system **refuses writes** outside the `allow_write` allowlist at runtime, not merely logs or warns.
- **ASSUM-009** (backs ADR-ARCH-021): LangGraph `interrupt()` survives external resume with a **typed Pydantic payload** round-trip — i.e. the resumed value is a fully-typed Pydantic model instance, not a dict or serialised blob.

Both assumptions are currently documented behaviour only. Both are load-bearing: ADR-021 (PAUSED via `interrupt()`) and ADR-023 (permissions as constitutional safety) are foundational to the Forge architecture.

### Scope

**In scope (spike):**
1. Minimal DeepAgents agent repro for permissions refusal.
2. Minimal two-file LangGraph repro for `interrupt()` + external `Command(resume=PydanticModel(...))` round-trip.
3. Findings written to `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`.
4. If a primitive **fails**: spawn a separate revision task for the affected ADR (ADR-021 or ADR-023). Do NOT mutate those ADRs from within the spike.

**Out of scope (spike):**
- Integration with the full Forge agent graph. Repros run standalone.
- Testing alternative pin ranges (e.g. 0.6.x) — pin is `>=0.5.3, <0.6` per ADR-020.
- Upgrades, fixes, or abstractions around either primitive if it works. Verification is binary.

### Repro design — ASSUM-008 (permissions refusal)

**Goal**: observe that a DeepAgents agent configured with `allow_write=["/tmp/ok/**"]` cannot write to `/tmp/forbidden/` at runtime — the call must be refused by the runtime, not merely flagged in logs.

**Minimal repro structure**:
```
spikes/deepagents-053/permissions_repro.py
  - Create DeepAgents agent with permissions: allow_write=["/tmp/ok/**"]
  - Instruct agent (via initial user message) to write to /tmp/forbidden/out.txt
  - Assert: file does NOT exist after run; agent's tool-call response reports refusal
```

**Success criteria**:
- `os.path.exists("/tmp/forbidden/out.txt")` is `False` after agent termination.
- Agent's tool-response transcript contains a refusal indication (exact wording TBD from DeepAgents 0.5.3 release).
- Exit is clean (no unhandled exception from the runtime itself).

**Failure criteria**:
- File is created at the forbidden path.
- Runtime raises an unhandled exception instead of returning a tool-level refusal.
- Agent's transcript does not indicate the write was refused (e.g. it silently "succeeds" returning a fake success message).

**If failure**: spawn `TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-023-<slug>` to revise ADR-ARCH-023 before `/system-design`. Options include: (a) promote permissions enforcement to an executor-side assertion per ADR-026's belt+braces pattern, (b) demote the permissions system from "constitutional safety" to "first-line defence" and add a second enforcement layer, (c) select an alternative primitive.

### Repro design — ASSUM-009 (`interrupt()` round-trip with typed Pydantic payload)

**Goal**: observe that a LangGraph graph calling `interrupt(payload: SomePydanticModel)` can be resumed from an external process via `Command(resume=SomePydanticModel(...))`, and that the value returned into the graph is a fully-instantiated Pydantic model (with types intact, `isinstance` checks passing).

**Minimal repro structure**:
```
spikes/deepagents-053/
  interrupt_graph.py        — defines a two-node graph with interrupt() using an ApprovalPayload Pydantic model
  interrupt_resume.py       — separate entry point that resumes the graph with Command(resume=ApprovalPayload(...))
```

**Success criteria**:
- `interrupt_graph.py` pauses at the interrupt call, returning control to the LangGraph runtime.
- `interrupt_resume.py` successfully resumes the paused graph.
- Inside the resumed graph, the received value satisfies `isinstance(value, ApprovalPayload) is True`.
- All typed fields on the Pydantic model (including nested models, UUIDs, datetimes, Literal types) are preserved.
- Clean exit; graph completes its second node.

**Failure criteria**:
- Resume is not possible from a separate process (e.g. requires in-process reference to the graph).
- Resumed value is a dict, not a Pydantic instance.
- Nested or complex field types (nested models, UUIDs, datetimes) are serialised to strings/dicts and not re-hydrated.
- Resume triggers a validation error on a round-tripped model.

**If failure**: spawn `TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-<slug>` to revise ADR-ARCH-021. Options include: (a) add an explicit `model_validate` step after resume inside the consumer, (b) change the resume payload contract to accept `model_dump()` + explicit deserialisation, (c) select an alternative HITL primitive (e.g. direct NATS approval without LangGraph-side interrupt).

### Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope creep into "improvement" work if a primitive works | High | Medium | Task brief is verification only. If it works, record a one-paragraph finding and stop. Do **not** propose abstractions. |
| Network / sandbox interference (e.g. DeepAgents permissions intercepting spike filesystem writes) | Medium | Low | Run repro with permissions explicitly configured for `/tmp/ok/**`. Spike directory lives outside permission scope. |
| LangGraph `interrupt()` semantics differ between `langgraph dev` server and CompiledStateGraph.invoke | Medium | High (invalidates the repro) | Test against both: `langgraph dev` server for the canonical path (matches Forge deployment) and direct `.invoke` for control. Flag divergence in findings. |
| Gemini / LLM API outage during agent runs in permissions repro | Low | Low | Permissions check doesn't require a capable LLM — stub model or use a trivial model response. The agent's *request* to write is scripted, not LLM-decided. |
| DeepAgents 0.5.3 `AsyncSubAgent` preview feature interacts with permissions in an undocumented way | Medium | Medium | Keep the permissions repro sync-only (no AsyncSubAgent). Interaction with async is a separate follow-up if flagged. |
| Findings captured but not written to `deepagents-053-verification.md` | Low | High (AC-5 failure) | Task workflow requires the file as an acceptance criterion. Make writing the file the first action after observing results. |

### Execution checklist (for the spawned spike task)

Pre-flight:
- [ ] Read ADR-ARCH-021, ADR-ARCH-023, and this scoping section.
- [ ] Confirm DeepAgents pin is `>=0.5.3, <0.6` in `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Confirm LangGraph version matches what `/system-design` will assume.

ASSUM-008 (permissions):
- [ ] Create `spikes/deepagents-053/permissions_repro.py`.
- [ ] Run; observe refusal or failure.
- [ ] If failure: stop, write finding, spawn revision task for ADR-023, stop spike.
- [ ] If success: write one-paragraph confirmation to `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`.

ASSUM-009 (`interrupt()` round-trip):
- [ ] Create `spikes/deepagents-053/interrupt_graph.py` and `interrupt_resume.py`.
- [ ] Run; observe typed resume or failure.
- [ ] Test against both `langgraph dev` and direct `.invoke`.
- [ ] If failure (either mode): stop, write finding, spawn revision task for ADR-021, stop spike.
- [ ] If success: write one-paragraph confirmation covering both modes to `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`.

Close-out:
- [ ] Commit findings file (`docs(research): deepagents 0.5.3 primitives verified — ASSUM-008/-009 (TASK-SPIKE-*)`).
- [ ] Link the findings file from ADR-021 and ADR-023's References section (append-only; one-line each).
- [ ] If revision task spawned: explicitly mark `/system-design` as blocked on that task's completion.

## Findings Summary

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | §13 Decision Index did not reference ADR-031; prose count showed "30 ADRs" | Low | **Fixed** (§1) |
| 2 | Graphiti parser warnings on ADR-012/-022 due to inline-bullet Status format | Low | **Fixed** (§2, re-ingestion clean) |
| 3 | §3 header "15 modules in 5 groups" did not match any defensible recount | Low | **Fixed** (§3, now "5 groups — 18 Python modules + 6 `@tool`-layer entries") |
| 4 | ADR-012 had not been reconciled against ADR-031's async-supervisor tool additions | Low | **Fixed** (§4, reconfirmation note appended to ADR-012 Context) |
| 5 | ASSUM-008 (permissions runtime refusal) is documented-only — load-bearing for ADR-023 | Medium | **Scoped** (§5, spike ready to execute in follow-up task) |
| 6 | ASSUM-009 (typed `interrupt()` round-trip) is documented-only — load-bearing for ADR-021 | Medium | **Scoped** (§5, spike ready to execute in follow-up task) |
| 7 | TASK-DOC-B2A4 superseded by this task (§1 folded it in verbatim) | Info | Pending archival |

## Recommendations

1. **Accept §1–§4 as complete** and close this review. All four acceptance criteria (AC-1 through AC-4) are met.
2. **Spawn a single follow-up spike task** — suggested ID pattern `TASK-SPIKE-<hash>`, title: *DeepAgents 0.5.3 primitives verification (ASSUM-008 permissions + ASSUM-009 interrupt round-trip)*. Use §5 of this report as its scoping source. Do not bundle the spike into this task's acceptance — it is load-bearing and deserves its own commit trail.
3. **Archive TASK-DOC-B2A4** as superseded by TASK-REV-A7D3. Move `tasks/backlog/TASK-DOC-B2A4/` to `tasks/completed/` with `status: superseded` in frontmatter and a one-line note in Implementation Notes pointing to this task.
4. **Commit discipline for §1–§4**: the task brief called for §1, §2, §3, §4 as separately revertable commits. Because the edits are small and tightly coupled to this review, a single commit that clearly enumerates each section in its message body is an acceptable alternative to four micro-commits — but *not* one that bundles the §5 spike.
5. **Block `/system-design` on the §5 spike** until the findings file is committed. Add a one-line note to the top of the follow-up spike task: *"`/system-design` is blocked on this task's completion."*

---

## Decision Options

**[A] Accept** — Mark §1–§4 as complete, close this review, archive TASK-DOC-B2A4. §5 spike must still run before `/system-design` — this option leaves spike scheduling to the user. Acceptable.

**[I] Implement** — Accept §1–§4 as complete, archive TASK-DOC-B2A4, and **create the follow-up `TASK-SPIKE-*` task in backlog** using §5 as its scoping source. Also blocks `/system-design` on the new task's completion. **Recommended** — this is the cleanest close-out and preserves the "no new ADRs from this task" boundary.

**[R] Revise** — Re-run the review with comprehensive depth (e.g. execute the §5 spike inside this task rather than spawning a separate one). Not recommended — the task's Known Risks explicitly calls out spike scope creep; spawning a dedicated task preserves commit isolation and the revertability property the task brief requires.

**[C] Cancel** — Discard the review, revert §1–§4 edits. Not recommended — the four paperwork items are zero-judgment polish with a clean pass, and the §5 scoping is useful independent of whether the spike runs immediately.

**Reviewer recommendation: [I] Implement.**

 ## Decision
 
 Forge does **not** expose an MCP interface. Forge is discoverable and controllable via:
All §1–§4 edits are present in commit 7bcc7da. Working tree now only has the archival move for TASK-DOC-B2A4 + TASK-REV-A7D3 metadata update + the review report — ready for checkpoint.

Phase 5: Decision Checkpoint — TASK-REV-A7D3
Review Results (see full report: .claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md)

§1–§4 score: 100/100 (all acceptance criteria met verbatim)
§5 status: scoped-not-executed per agreed hybrid workflow
Findings: 7 · Recommendations: 5
What landed (already in commit 7bcc7da):

§1: ARCHITECTURE.md §13 — 30 ADRs→31 ADRs, ADR-031 row added
§2: ADR-012 and ADR-022 Status reformatted; Graphiti re-ingestion clean (exit 0, no Status-warning)
§3: ARCHITECTURE.md §3 header now reads "5 groups — 18 Python modules + 6 @tool-layer entries"
§4: ADR-012 reconfirmation note appended (reasoning holds; larger tool surface strengthens the MCP-rejection argument)
What's unstaged (waiting for commit at checkpoint close):

.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md — full review + §5 scoping

tasks/backlog/TASK-DOC-B2A4/ → tasks/completed/TASK-DOC-B2A4/ — archived as superseded
Caveats:

AC-7 commit message: the task's AC-7 requires a commit message referencing both TASK-DOC-B2A4 and TASK-REV-A7D3. Commit 7bcc7da ("review and refinements of architecture") bundled §1–§4 with other in-flight work and does not reference either ID. The upcoming archival-move commit is the natural place to satisfy AC-7 — suggest message along the lines of docs/tasks: close TASK-REV-A7D3 §1–§4; archive TASK-DOC-B2A4 as superseded.
AC-5 deferred: docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md is not yet committed. Per option 3, §5 is scoping-only here; the spike needs a spawned TASK-SPIKE-* task.
Decision Options:

[A] Accept — Close review as-is. §1–§4 stand; §5 left for you to schedule separately. /system-design would be unblocked on §5 only when you run the spike manually.
[I] Implement — Accept §1–§4, archive TASK-DOC-B2A4, and create a TASK-SPIKE-* backlog task pre-populated from §5 of the review report. Also marks /system-design as blocked on that new task. Recommended.
[R] Revise — Re-run review at comprehensive depth (e.g. execute the spike inline). Not recommended — the task's Known Risks explicitly warn against spike scope creep from within this task.
[C] Cancel — Discard the review, revert §1–§4. Not recommended — the paperwork is a clean pass.
Which do you want? ([A] / [I] / [R] / [C])

# Task: DeepAgents 0.5.3 primitives verification

## Description

Verify at runtime that two DeepAgents 0.5.3 / LangGraph primitives behave
as their backing ADRs assume. Both assumptions are currently documented
behaviour only, and both are load-bearing for Forge's architecture:

- **ASSUM-008** (backs ADR-ARCH-023 — permissions as constitutional
  safety): the DeepAgents permissions system **refuses writes** outside
  the `allow_write` allowlist at runtime, not merely logs or warns.
- **ASSUM-009** (backs ADR-ARCH-021 — PAUSED via `interrupt()`):
  LangGraph `interrupt()` survives external resume with a **typed
  Pydantic payload** round-trip — the resumed value is a fully-typed
  Pydantic model instance, not a dict or serialised blob.

Full scoping, repro designs, success/failure criteria, and risk register
live in `.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md` §5. This task
file carries the acceptance criteria; the review report carries the
detailed design.

`/system-design` is **blocked on this task's completion.** Findings
must be committed to `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`
before `/system-design` runs.

## Origin

Spawned from TASK-REV-A7D3 [I]mplement decision on 2026-04-19. §5 of
that task (the two verification spikes) was scoped but not executed
during the review, so it could live in a discrete commit trail with
bounded scope. TASK-REV-A7D3 §1–§4 (doc paperwork) are complete; this
spike is the last remaining gate before `/system-design`.

## Scope

### In scope

1. Minimal DeepAgents agent repro for permissions refusal
   (`spikes/deepagents-053/permissions_repro.py`).
2. Minimal two-file LangGraph repro for `interrupt()` + external
   `Command(resume=PydanticModel(...))` round-trip
   (`spikes/deepagents-053/interrupt_graph.py`,
   `spikes/deepagents-053/interrupt_resume.py`).
3. Findings file committed:
   `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`, summarising
   results for both ASSUM-008 and ASSUM-009.
4. On **failure** of either primitive: spawn a separate revision task
   for the affected ADR (`TASK-ADR-REVISE-023-*` or
   `TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-*`). Mark this spike as blocked on that new
   task, and keep `/system-design` blocked until it resolves.

### Out of scope

- Integration with the Forge agent graph. Repros run standalone.
- Testing alternative pin ranges (e.g. 0.6.x). Pin is `>=0.5.3, <0.6`
  per ADR-ARCH-020.
- Improvements or abstractions around either primitive **if it works**.
  Verification is binary — record and move on. The parent task's Known
  Risks explicitly flag this as a scope-creep risk.
- Edits to ADR-021 or ADR-023 directly from this spike, even on
  failure. Revisions happen in a spawned task with its own review.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `spikes/deepagents-053/permissions_repro.py` exists and has been
      executed at least once. Result (pass/fail) is observed.
- [ ] `spikes/deepagents-053/interrupt_graph.py` and `interrupt_resume.py`
      exist and have been executed together to demonstrate a full
      pause-and-resume cycle. Result (pass/fail) is observed under
      both `langgraph dev` and direct `CompiledStateGraph.invoke`
      execution modes.
- [ ] `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md` is committed
      with one-paragraph findings for each of ASSUM-008 and ASSUM-009.
- [ ] If ASSUM-008 fails: `TASK-ADR-REVISE-023-*` exists in backlog;
      `/system-design` explicitly blocked on it.
- [ ] If ASSUM-009 fails: `TASK-ADR-REVISE-021-*` exists in backlog;
      `/system-design` explicitly blocked on it.
- [ ] Findings file is linked from ADR-021 and ADR-023's References
      section (append-only, one line each).
- [ ] Commit message references `TASK-SPIKE-C1E9` and `TASK-REV-A7D3`
      (and, if applicable, the spawned revision task IDs).

## Method

Follow the execution checklist in
`.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md` §5 (*"Execution
checklist (for the spawned spike task)"*) verbatim. That checklist
already covers pre-flight, ASSUM-008, ASSUM-009, and close-out. It is
the canonical source of sequence and stop-conditions for this task.

**Do not re-scope the spike from this task file.** The scoping is
frozen in the review report so that any divergence in interpretation
is explicit.

## Source Material

- `.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A7D3-review-report.md` §5 — full scoping,
  repro designs, risk register, execution checklist.
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-021-paused-via-langgraph-interrupt.md`
  — ASSUM-009 backing ADR.
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-023-permissions-constitutional-safety.md`
  — ASSUM-008 backing ADR.
- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-ARCH-020-adopt-deepagents-builtins.md`
  — pin rationale (`>=0.5.3, <0.6`).
- DeepAgents 0.5.3 release notes (15 April 2026) — fetch at execution
  time via WebFetch if needed, do not rely on cached derivations.

## Known Risks / Watch-outs

- **Scope creep.** If a primitive works, record a one-paragraph
  finding and stop. Do not propose abstractions.
- **Mode divergence on `interrupt()`.** `langgraph dev` server and
  direct `.invoke` may behave differently. Test both. If they diverge,
  that is itself a finding.
- **Permissions interference with spike filesystem.** Run the
  permissions repro with `allow_write=["/tmp/ok/**"]` explicitly;
  spike directory lives outside permission scope.
- **Findings file omission.** The acceptance criterion explicitly
  requires `docs/research/ideas/deepagents-053-verification.md`. Make
  writing the file the **first** action after observing either result.
- **ADR mutation.** Do NOT edit ADR-021 or ADR-023 directly. On
  failure, spawn a revision task.

## Test Requirements

- Executable repros. Each must run cleanly (pass or fail
  informatively) on the current DeepAgents 0.5.3 + LangGraph pinned
  versions.
- Findings file is prose; verification is peer review by Rich.

Downstream state:

TASK-DOC-B2A4 archived as superseded
TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 in backlog, blocks /system-design
⚠️ State anomaly detected mid-workflow (corrected before commit): tasks/in_progress/TASK-SPIKE-C1E9/ appeared mid-run despite the spike task being created in tasks/backlog/ and its frontmatter still reading status: backlog. Likely a file-watcher/auto-grooming side-effect. I moved it back to tasks/backlog/ to match its frontmatter. If you intended to start the spike, run /task-work TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 (which will update frontmatter consistently).

Next: Run TASK-SPIKE-C1E9 when ready to unblock /system-design.


Summary
Review: TASK-REV-F1B8 scored 78/100 — amendment substantively correct, three formal gaps (ADR-020 annotation, interrupt() interaction coverage, cross-references). Decision: [I]mplement.

Applied:

ADR-ARCH-020 — 4-line amendment appendix pointing to ADR-ARCH-031 (append-only, no edits above).
ADR-ARCH-031 — new "Interaction with ADR-ARCH-021 (interrupt())" subsection before Crash recovery, verifying no conflict with the PAUSED protocol.
ADR-ARCH-031 References — added one-line cross-refs to ADR-ARCH-002, -007, -008, -021.
Created: follow-up task TASK-DOC-B2A4 — append ADR-031 row to ARCHITECTURE.md §13 Decision Index (conversation-capture line 260 commitment).

Task state: TASK-REV-F1B8 moved to in_review/ with status: review_complete, decision: implement, score: 78, and full artefact/follow-up trail in front-matter + Implementation Notes.

Deferred (not blocking): pruning ADR-ARCH-031 from 135 → 60–80 lines — illustrative material (langgraph.json, forge history narrative) is not load-bearing; trim only if you want the tighter target.

Originally referenced TASK-NCFA-002 in DDR-001 + API-nats-pipeline-events — that ID was already taken (a completed integration-tests task from wave 2 of forge-v2-alignment). Actual new task is TASK-NCFA-003.
Three of the four payloads I specified (StageCompletePayload, BuildPausedPayload, BuildResumedPayload) already exist in nats-core from TASK-NCFA-001 (completed 2026-04-16), but with different field signatures. Only BuildCancelledPayload is truly net-new.
Scope of TASK-NCFA-003: reconcile 3 existing payloads + add 1 new one. Forge carries canonical-shape interim types locally until nats-core ≥ 0.2.0 ships the reconciled shapes.
First seeding attempt failed silently — used a non-existent --group flag from the command template. Corrected to --type adr for DDRs, auto-detect (full_doc) for contracts/models. Groups in .guardkit/graphiti.yaml are inferred from parser type, not a direct CLI option. Also added ## Status section headers to all 6 DDRs so the ADR parser accepts them.

I'll report back with the final seed log once the background job notifies completion.


















Review — nats-core 0.2.0 alignment in Forge
Mode: architectural / code-quality (dependency update)
Depth: standard
Scope: what "update the dependency" means in this pre-scaffold Forge repo.

Context
Forge is still at the design stage — src/forge/ contains only the DeepAgents scaffold (__init__.py, agent.py). There is no forge/adapters/nats/ directory and no _interim_payloads.py to delete. The nats-core 0.2.0 alignment affects Forge's design docs and future dependency pin, not yet-written code.

The interim-carrier arrangement was forecast by DDR-001:32 and API-nats-pipeline-events.md:152 as a contingency if Forge's adapter had to be written before nats-core reconciled. It never materialised — nats-core 0.2.0 shipped first.

Findings
1. [HIGH] Shape divergence: timestamps are str, not datetime (confirmed by reading sibling repo)
nats-core 0.2.0 at _pipeline.py:445, _pipeline.py:476, _pipeline.py:518, _pipeline.py:546 declares:

paused_at: str, resumed_at: str, completed_at: str, cancelled_at: str — all ISO-8601 strings.
Forge's design contract at API-nats-pipeline-events.md:117-148 still specifies these as datetime. The shipped library wins (it's code, not a draft), so Forge's contract must be updated to str. All other fields (status, gate_mode, decision, target_kind literals) match — UPPERCASE where Forge wanted UPPERCASE, lowercase decision where Forge wanted lowercase.

2. [LOW] _interim_payloads.py was never created
The cleanup step in nats-core's announcement ("delete forge/forge/adapters/nats/_interim_payloads.py") is a no-op here. Design docs forecasting it should be rewritten to reflect that the interim carrier is retired-before-creation.

3. [MED] nats-core is not yet pinned in pyproject.toml
No nats-core dependency exists in pyproject.toml:10-19. Not required today (no importer), but pinning now locks the 0.2.x compat boundary ahead of the scaffold task. Equally valid to defer to the NATS-adapter implementation task.

4. [MED] Three doc locations reference the now-resolved blocker
DDR-001:24,32,50 — "Until nats-core ≥ 0.2.0…" language
API-nats-pipeline-events.md:103,152 — same forecast + interim-file reference
assumptions.yaml:38-41 — ASSUM-004 still says "v0.1+"
Recommendations
#	Action	File(s)
R1	Update timestamp fields datetime → str in the inline payload examples	API-nats-pipeline-events.md:117,129,139,148
R2	Remove "Until nats-core ≥ 0.2.0 ships…" caveat; state Forge imports from nats_core.events.pipeline	API-nats-pipeline-events.md:103,152
R3	Append resolution note to DDR-001: nats-core 0.2.0 shipped 2026-04-23; interim carrier retired before creation	DDR-001
R4	Bump ASSUM-004 to nats-core (v0.2.0) with BuildCancelledPayload note	assumptions.yaml:38
R5	Add nats-core>=0.2.0,<0.3 to pyproject.toml dependencies	pyproject.toml:10
R5 is optional now but cheap and prevents drift once the scaffold lands. R1 is the must-fix — a shape mismatch between your own contract and the shipped library is a trap waiting for the adapter author.

Decision
[A]pply R1–R5 as a single doc/config update now.
[R1–R4 only] Docs-only update; defer the pin to the NATS-adapter task.
[R1+R3 only] Minimal — fix the shape mismatch + note resolution, rewrite the rest when the adapter is written.
[D]efer all of it until TASK-FORGE-SCAFFOLD or the NATS-adapter implementation task — leave the forecast language in place until there's code to align against.
[C]ancel
Which would you like?

A

All five recommendations applied:

#	File	Change
R1	API-nats-pipeline-events.md:117,129,139,148	Timestamps datetime → str (ISO-8601) on all four payloads
R2	API-nats-pipeline-events.md:103,159	Removed "Until nats-core ≥ 0.2.0…" caveat; added from nats_core.events.pipeline import … stanza
R3	DDR-001:3	Status now reads "Accepted — interim-carrier clause superseded 2026-04-23" with resolution block; Context/Decision prose preserved as historical record
R4	assumptions.yaml:38	ASSUM-004 bumped to v0.2.0 with BuildCancelledPayload + ISO-8601 note
R5	pyproject.toml:16	nats-core>=0.2.0,<0.3 added to dependencies; tomllib parse confirmed
Nothing to delete — forge/adapters/nats/_interim_payloads.py never existed because the scaffold post-dates the nats-core release. The review task is complete; next step on your side is presumably to signal nats-core that Forge is aligned, then /task-complete TASK-NCFA-003 in the nats-core repo.

Run these seeding commands now? [Y/n]

(20 commands total. Diagrams are not seeded — they're visual + already referenced by the L2 container doc.)

Next steps regardless of seeding:

Review key design calls — especially the 4-payload addition to nats-core (DDR-001) and the forge.adapters.langgraph helper placement (DDR-002).
Raise TASK-NCFA-002 in the nats-core repo for the payload additions.
Feed these artefacts into /feature-spec / /feature-plan sessions when you're ready to carve Forge into implementable features.
If you want me to also append an entry to docs/history/system-design-history.md, say so.

Updated docs/research/ideas/forge-build-plan.md:

Top status line → /feature-spec 🟡 1 / 8 (FEAT-FORGE-001 ✅).
Progress-log table → Step 3 row now reports 1/8 in progress with artefact path and assumption counts.
Step 3 heading → IN PROGRESS (1 / 8) with a "Completed" list pointing to features/pipeline-state-machine-and-configuration/ and the two low-confidence assumptions flagged for review.
Step 3 FEAT-FORGE-001 command block → marked ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-24) and annotated with its output directory.
Step 4 rewritten so every /feature-plan invocation takes the matching {slug}_summary.md as --context. The FEAT-FORGE-001 line now exactly mirrors the "Next steps" command I emitted in the feature-spec completion summary; the other seven features use <feat-forge-NNN-slug> placeholders with a note that the slug is kebab-case of the feature name (not the ID) and resolves when each /feature-spec completes.
whats the next step?
Two choices, depending on whether you want to resolve open items first or keep momentum on the spec pass.

Option 1 — Clear the low-confidence assumptions on FEAT-FORGE-001 first (recommended before /feature-plan runs against it):

ASSUM-002 — is there a real maximum max_turns? Or should the upper-bound boundary scenarios be dropped?
ASSUM-005 — single-operator or audit-distinct cancel-vs-originate identity? If single-operator, the cancel-audit scenario can be removed or simplified.
Both are in features/pipeline-state-machine-and-configuration/pipeline-state-machine-and-configuration_assumptions.yaml.

Option 2 — Continue the spec pass with the next feature in Step 3:


/feature-spec FEAT-FORGE-002 \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-nats-pipeline-events.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-nats-fleet-lifecycle.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/models/DM-discovery.md \
  --context nats-core/docs/design/specs/nats-core-system-spec.md \
  --context nats-core/docs/design/contracts/agent-manifest-contract.md
My recommendation: resolve the two low-confidence assumptions now (cheap — two quick answers) then move on to FEAT-FORGE-002. Leaving them unresolved means /feature-plan FEAT-FORGE-001 will inherit the ambiguity into tasks.

let's work on Option 1 — Clear the low-confidence assumptions on FEAT-FORGE-001 first (
Grep "max_turns|max-turns|turn.?budget|turn.?limit" (glob: docs/**/*.md)
31 lines of output
Grep "originating_user|operator|audit.*(cancel|user)|responder" (glob: docs/design/**/*.md)
31 lines of output
Two questions — each takes one decision.

ASSUM-002 — upper bound on reasoning-turn budget?

The context states max_turns default of 5 (forge.yaml and Build.max_turns) but no ceiling. The data model DM-build-lifecycle.md:40 types it as int with default 5 — no max. Choices:

(a) Keep 20 as an arbitrary-but-generous ceiling. Rationale: "anything higher is almost certainly a mistake; the stage timeout will kill it anyway."
(b) Pick a different number (e.g. 10, 50). Say the value.
(c) Remove the upper-bound entirely. I drop the | 20 | row from the accept-boundary Examples and lose the notion of a max. max_turns is then only bounded below by ≥ 1. Lowest-risk option — the lower bound is the only one that's a genuine safety requirement.
(d) Defer. Hold the scenario until forge.yaml schema validation is specified explicitly.
ASSUM-005 — distinct cancelling-operator vs originating-operator identity?

The data model already separates these: originating_user on the build record DM-build-lifecycle.md:28, responder on the approval resolution DM-build-lifecycle.md:148. The scenario tests that both are preserved when they differ. Choices:

(a) Confirm as-is. Keep the scenario; update confidence to medium (the schema supports it, just wasn't stated as a requirement).
(b) Single-operator mode — remove the scenario. Rationale: "Forge is solo-use; if I cancel my own build there's no distinct identity to preserve." Drop Group E scenario 2; keep path-traversal.
(c) Simplify. Keep the scenario but drop the "different operator" framing — just assert the cancel reason and responder are recorded. No identity comparison.
My suggestion: (c) for ASSUM-002 (lose the arbitrary ceiling) and (a) for ASSUM-005 (the schema already encodes the distinction; promote to medium). But your call.

accept your reccomendations
Applying recommendations: drop the 20-turn ceiling (ASSUM-002 removed), promote cancel-operator audit to medium (ASSUM-005).

Revisions applied across the four files.

Changes

.feature — dropped the | 20 | row from the accept-boundary Scenario Outline and retitled it "at or above the minimum are accepted"; removed the ASSUM-002 comment; upgraded the ASSUM-005 comment to medium with schema-grounded basis.
_assumptions.yaml — review_required: false; ASSUM-002 moved to a retired_assumptions: block with reason; ASSUM-005 confidence medium with basis citing Build.originating_user and the approval responder field.
_summary.md — 34 scenarios, 5 assumptions (all medium, all confirmed); "Review required: No"; retired-assumptions section added.
forge-build-plan.md — Step 3 progress row and completion block now show 34 scenarios, 5 medium assumptions, 0 open — "Ready for /feature-plan".
Next step: FEAT-FORGE-002 /feature-spec (command in docs/research/ideas/forge-build-plan.md Step 3) when you're ready.

Notes
AutoBuild ready: /feature-build FEAT-FORGE-004
Step 11 (BDD @task: linking) deferred: the .feature file has a Gherkin syntax error on line 176 (informal Or keyword instead of And). TASK-CGCP-012 absorbs this as a prerequisite fix in its acceptance criteria
R3 smoke gate not configured: 5-wave feature would benefit from between-wave smoke gates. To activate, add a smoke_gates: block to .guardkit/features/FEAT-FORGE-004.yaml (e.g. python -c "import forge.gating" after Wave 2)
Upstream gate: Wave 4 (state-machine integration) requires FEAT-FORGE-001/002/003 to be in place; pause and surface the missing seam if not

⚠️ R3 smoke gates: not configured (notice from generator — see below)
Two non-blocking notes for follow-up

R3 smoke gates — the generator surfaced the >=2 waves, no smoke_gates: key notice. Worth adding a between-wave smoke check to .guardkit/features/FEAT-FORGE-005.yaml before /feature-build (e.g. python -c "from forge.adapters.guardkit import GuardKitResult" after wave 1, pytest tests/bdd -k "guardkit and key_example" -x after wave 4). I left it unset so you can decide what's worth gating.
Build plan progress log — the FEAT-FORGE-005 row at docs/research/ideas/forge-build-plan.md:16 still shows ◻ pending for Step 4 (/feature-plan). Want me to flip that to 🟡 in progress (or ✅ complete) and add today's date + the wave map?
Next: guardkit feature-build FEAT-FORGE-005 when you're ready to autobuild, or guardkit task-work TASK-GCI-001 to start wave 1 manually.

Outstanding Notes
⚠️ R3 smoke gates not configured. The generator nudged that .guardkit/features/FEAT-8D10.yaml has 6 waves but no smoke_gates: block. Between-wave smoke checks won't fire during /feature-build. To activate, add a block like:


smoke_gates:
  after_wave_1:
    - python -c "from forge.memory.models import GateDecision"
  after_wave_4:
    - pytest tests/unit -x
Next Steps
Read IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md — the Data Flow diagram (§1) is required reading.
Optionally add smoke_gates: to .guardkit/features/FEAT-8D10.yaml for between-wave composition checks.
Start Wave 1 in parallel: /task-work TASK-IC-001 and /task-work TASK-IC-009 (Conductor workspaces recommended).
Or autonomous: /feature-build FEAT-8D10.
Want me to /schedule an agent for 24h after /feature-build completes to triage the first BDD oracle run on the smoke scenarios?

Quality Notes
✅ Zero unverifiable acceptance criteria (AC-quality linter passed)
⚠️ R3 smoke gates not configured — smoke_gates: block not added to FEAT-CBDE.yaml. This is the gate that catches composition failures between waves. Recommend adding before running /feature-build (see notice in script output)

Plan is updated. Here's where you actually are and what comes next.

Status (corrected)
Stage	Done	Pending
/system-arch	✅	—
/system-design	✅	—
/feature-spec	7/8 (001–007)	008
/feature-plan	6/8 (002–007)	008 (001 skipped — folded in)

Validation	◻	—
FinProxy run	◻	—
The doc previously claimed 5/8 specs in the header (and 6/8 in the body) — both stale. Reality is 7/8 across the board for 002–007.

Your suggested next step needs one prior step
You proposed running:


guardkit feature-plan FEAT-FORGE-008 \
  --context forge/features/<feat-forge-008-slug>/<feat-forge-008-slug>_summary.md
That's blocked: /feature-spec FEAT-FORGE-008 has not been run yet, so the slug directory doesn't exist. The placeholder can't be resolved.

Recommended sequence
/feature-spec FEAT-FORGE-008 — produces features/mode-b-feature-and-mode-c-review-fix/ (slug TBD). Updated context flags now in forge-build-plan.md Step 3:


guardkit feature-spec FEAT-FORGE-008 \
  --context forge/features/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end.feature \
  --context forge/features/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end/mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end_summary.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-cli.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-nats-approval-protocol.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/models/DM-build-lifecycle.md
The previous spec command was wrong — it pointed at forge/features/FEAT-FORGE-007/feature-spec.md, which never existed (the real path is mode-a-greenfield-end-to-end/).

/feature-plan FEAT-FORGE-008 — your suggested command, with the real slug substituted once Step 1 completes.

autobuild FEAT-FORGE-008 — Wave 6.

Step 6 validation — including the four LES1 parity gates (CMDW / PORT / ARFS / canonical-freeze) before declaring the build canonical.

Step 7 FinProxy first run.

One thing worth deciding before you start 008
FEAT-FORGE-001 was never planned or autobuilt. The src tree (pipeline/, config/, etc.) was populated piecemeal by 002–007, which works in practice but means there's no isolated coverage of the foundation contract: forge queue CLI surface, forge.yaml loader, SQLite-backed crash recovery as a unit. The doc now says: if Step 6 validation exposes a gap, spawn a discrete FEAT-FORGE-009 to backfill rather than retro-running 001. If you'd rather close that gap before 008 (cleaner foundation, but adds days), say so and I'll flip the recommendation.

let's close that gap


Quick gap analysis — what FEAT-FORGE-001 specced vs. what's actually in the tree:

Specced	Status
CLI: forge queue / status / history / cancel / skip	❌ Missing — no cli/ package, no console_scripts in pyproject
Build-lifecycle state machine (IDLE→PREPARING→RUNNING→FINALISING→COMPLETE/FAILED)	❌ Missing — pipeline/ has stage-ordering guards (within a build) but not the lifecycle state machine
SQLite history (builds + stage_log per DDR-003)	❌ Missing — sqlite usage exists in memory/ and dispatch/persistence.py but no central build-history schema
Crash recovery (rehydrate every lifecycle state on restart)	❌ Missing
Sequential queue per-project (max_concurrent=1)	❌ Missing as discrete enforcement
Path-traversal validation on feature_id	❌ Missing
Cancel-operator audit trail	❌ Missing
This is a real gap — 002–007 assume the queue/CLI/lifecycle surface exists upstream and just plug into the parts they need (config, NATS adapters). Nothing has actually built forge queue or the build-lifecycle state machine.

Recommended path
Don't blindly re-run /feature-plan FEAT-FORGE-001 — the existing spec was written assuming a clean slate, so a naive plan will duplicate config/manifest work that 002–007 already shipped (e.g. forge.config.models already has FleetConfig, ApprovalConfig, etc.).

Instead, do this:

I write a short forge-001-gap-context.md — per-scenario coverage table (covered / partial / missing) so /feature-plan knows what to skip and what to focus on.
You run /feature-plan FEAT-FORGE-001 --context <spec_summary> --context <gap-context> — produces a plan scoped to the missing pieces only.
You run autobuild FEAT-FORGE-001 — Wave 1 backfill.
Then proceed to FEAT-FORGE-008 (spec → plan → build).
The gap-context doc is the load-bearing piece — without it, the plan will produce duplicated work.

Alternative (heavier ceremony, cleaner separation): spec a new FEAT-FORGE-001B titled something like "Build Lifecycle CLI & Crash Recovery" covering only the missing scope, then plan + build that. Keeps the original FEAT-FORGE-001 spec untouched as the canonical contract, and the new feature is the implementation slice.

I'd recommend option 1 (gap-context + re-plan) — keeps the FEAT-FORGE-NNN numbering coherent and reuses the existing 34-scenario spec rather than splitting it. Which way do you want to go? If option 1, I'll write the gap-context doc next.



proceed with option 1 then I can run the feature-plan

Gap-context doc written to docs/research/ideas/forge-001-gap-context.md.

It maps every one of the 34 FEAT-FORGE-001 scenarios to either reuse (existing modules from 002–007) or build (new code under src/forge/lifecycle/ + src/forge/cli/), with explicit "MUST NOT" rules so the plan doesn't duplicate config models, executor logic, NATS adapters, or stage guards.

Key finding worth flagging: the executor logic for cancel/skip is already shipped in pipeline/cli_steering.py with all the right Protocol seams waiting for FEAT-FORGE-001's concrete persistence-backed implementations. So the plan should produce a much thinner FEAT-FORGE-001 than the spec implied — primarily one new package (src/forge/lifecycle/) covering SQLite persistence, the lifecycle state machine, sequential-queue picker, crash recovery, and identifier validation, plus a thin src/forge/cli/ package and a console_scripts entry-point edit.

Run it

guardkit feature-plan "Pipeline State Machine and Configuration" \
  --context forge/features/pipeline-state-machine-and-configuration/pipeline-state-machine-and-configuration_summary.md \
  --context forge/docs/research/ideas/forge-001-gap-context.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-cli.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/contracts/API-sqlite-schema.md \
  --context forge/docs/design/decisions/DDR-003-sqlite-schema-layout-wal.md


The same command block is recorded in §"How to use this document" of the gap-context doc itself, so the plan picks it up regardless of where it's invoked from.

After the plan completes, the next steps are: review the task breakdown (sanity-check that nothing under §5 "MUST NOT" leaked in), then autobuild FEAT-FORGE-001, then proceed to FEAT-FORGE-008.

   • 0 below confidence threshold (0.60)
   • 0 already tagged
   • R2 BDD oracle is now active for this feature

🎯 Architectural invariants enforced (per review concerns)
   sc_001  state_machine.py is sole writer of builds.state
   sc_002  Write-then-publish: SQLite row survives NATS failure
   sc_003  Identifier validation: decode-then-allowlist
   sc_004  PAUSED-recovery preserves original request_id

⚠️  Smoke gates not configured (R3 nudge fired)
   The YAML has no smoke_gates: block. Between-wave smoke checks won't
   fire during autobuild — composition failures (the PEX-014..020 pattern)
   may slip through per-task Coach validation. Recommended additions:

     smoke_gates:
       after_wave_1:
         - python -c "from forge.lifecycle import identifiers, migrations; from forge.config.loader import load_config"
       after_wave_3:
         - python -c "from forge.lifecycle.persistence import SqliteLifecyclePersistence"
       after_wave_4:
         - forge --help

🚀 Next steps
   guardkit autobuild feature FEAT-FORGE-001     # full autonomous build
   /task-work TASK-PSM-001                        # individual task
Want me to add the smoke_gates: block to .guardkit/features/FEAT-FORGE-001.yaml before you kick off autobuild?


Smoke gates wired and validated. Final state:


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ SMOKE GATES CONFIGURED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📁 .guardkit/smoke/feat-forge-001-smoke.py     (executable, 4 checks)
📁 .guardkit/features/FEAT-FORGE-001.yaml      (smoke_gates block added)

Configuration
   after_wave: all          (fires between every wave 1→5)
   command:    python3 .guardkit/smoke/feat-forge-001-smoke.py
   timeout:    60s
   expected:   exit 0

Hard invariants enforced (run after every wave, skip when N/A)
   1. sc_001 — exactly one location in src/ may issue
                 `UPDATE builds SET status` (state_machine + persistence
                 boundary). Catches accidental status writes from CLI
                 commands or recovery code.
   2. Import discipline — cli/status.py and cli/history.py MUST NOT
                 import from forge.adapters.nats.* (Group H resilience).
   3. Foundation imports — every lifecycle/config module that exists
                 must import without error (catches broken composition).
   4. CLI smoke — once forge binary is on PATH, `forge --help` exits 0
                 and lists all five subcommands.

Smoke run today (pre-build): all four checks skip cleanly, exits 0.
Once Wave 3 ships persistence.py, sc_001 becomes a hard invariant.
Once Wave 4 ships cli/status.py and cli/history.py, import discipline
becomes hard. Once Wave 5 ships console_scripts, forge --help becomes
hard.

Wave 3: 006, 007        ← terminal handlers

Wave 6: 010, 011, 012   ← smoke + BDD bindings
Wave 7: 013, 014        ← cross-mode concurrency + crash recovery
Key design decisions:

Composition-only — no new state-machine transitions, no new dispatchers; reuses dispatch_subprocess_stage, dispatch_autobuild_async, ConstitutionalGuard unchanged
Mode A byte-identical — TASK-MBC8-008 keeps the existing match build.mode Mode A branch untouched so FEAT-FORGE-007 regression suite stays green
Mode boundary security at the planner layer — ModeBoundaryViolation raised by ModeBChainPlanner if a manifest references /system-arch or /system-design
Mode C cycle terminates on reviewer judgement (ASSUM-010, no numeric cap) — observable budget risk logged in §6
Three real cross-task contracts pinned in §4: FixTaskList, AutobuildResult.changed_files_count, ModeAwareStageEntry
Next steps:
