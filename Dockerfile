# Forge production image — multi-stage (TASK-F009-002 skeleton +
# TASK-F009-005 install layer).
#
# Per ASSUM-010 + ADR-ARCH-032:
#   * Both stages MUST start FROM python:3.14-slim-bookworm pinned to the
#     SAME sha256 digest. A floating tag would re-introduce the supply
#     chain regression that scenario E1.1 forbids.
#   * The runtime stage MUST run as a non-root ``forge`` user (UID 1000)
#     so ``docker run --rm forge:skel id -u`` returns 1000 (scenario C2,
#     acceptance criterion AC-G).
#   * No real provider API keys, no .env, no SSH server, no remote
#     debugger may appear in either stage (scenarios C1, E1.3).
#
# TASK-F009-005 wires nats-core via the operator-decided
# ``Q4 = (c) BuildKit named build context`` (scoping §11.4):
#   * ``COPY --from=nats-core / /tmp/nats-core`` pulls the sibling
#     working tree into the build via
#     ``--build-context nats-core=../nats-core``.
#   * nats-core is installed from /tmp/nats-core BEFORE
#     ``pip install .[providers]`` so pip's resolver treats nats-core
#     as already-satisfied and never reaches PyPI for the malformed
#     0.2.0 wheel (TASK-FIX-F0E6 / TASK-REV-F0E4 §5.1).
#   * ``pyproject.toml`` is NOT mutated inside the layer — the dev-host
#     ``[tool.uv.sources]`` semantics are preserved (scoping §11.4).
#   * Only the resolved venv crosses the builder→runtime boundary; gcc,
#     build-essential, and apt-cache state stay behind in the discarded
#     builder layer.
