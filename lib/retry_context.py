"""Retry input construction and structural context preservation.

Two helpers that keep the Player→Coach rejection-revision loop from drifting
off-corpus on large inputs:

1. ``build_context_manifest`` — distils the original target into a structural
   manifest (file list + scope/constraints) that can be re-attached to every
   retry prompt. Without this, models fabricate filenames on revision
   iterations when the input corpus is large (15+ documents). This is
   Category C from specialist-agent testing.

2. ``build_retry_input`` — shapes the retry payload as a single ``user``-role
   message containing the Coach feedback, the context manifest, and the
   Player's previous output. Follows the
   ``ainvoke()``-never-takes-system-messages contract documented in
   TASK-REV-R2A1: ``create_agent()`` unconditionally prepends ``system_prompt``
   on every call, so any ``system`` role messages in the input produce dual
   system messages and vLLM returns ``HTTP 400``.

Both helpers were originally introduced inline in the weighted-evaluation
orchestrator scaffold (commit ``dfa8090d``). Promoting them here gives the
orchestrator template a vendorable single source of truth and avoids the
two-copies-drift-over-time problem.

Dependencies: stdlib only.

def build_context_manifest(target: dict[str, Any], context: str) -> str:
    """Distill ``target`` + ``context`` into a structural manifest for retries.

    The manifest is what the Player gets re-shown on every revision so it does
    not fabricate filenames or drift off-corpus. Prefer structured metadata
    from ``target`` first; fall back to a context-size summary only if the
    target carries no structural hints.

    Extraction order (first match wins):

    1. ``target['files']`` (list of str or dict with ``name``/``path``) —
       rendered as a bulleted "Document manifest" section.
    2. ``target['documents']`` — same handling as ``files``.
    3. ``target['scope']`` or ``target['constraints']`` — appended as a
       "Scope" section. Can appear alongside the document manifest.
    4. Fallback: a one-liner summarising the context size in lines. Only
       emitted when no structured metadata is present.

    Args:
        target: Original target specification. A free-form dict — we read
            only the optional keys listed above.
        context: Prefetched domain context string (the raw corpus the Player
            saw on the first attempt).

    Returns:
        Manifest string suitable for inclusion in :func:`build_retry_input`.
        Empty string if neither structured metadata nor context is available.

    The single-``user``-message shape is required by TASK-REV-R2A1: the

            rejected).
        issues: Coach feedback issues or extraction error messages. Joined

        context_manifest: Optional structural context produced by
