ADR-SP-015 — Specialist-Agent Dual-Role Deployment Model
ADR-SP-016 — Singular agents.command.* / agents.result.* convention
ADR-SP-017 — PIPELINE/AGENTS/SYSTEM stream retention reconciliation
TASK-FVD1 promotes them to Accepted once you sign off.

Graphiti seeded
5 episodes queued into group_id: architecture_decisions (the shared convention across nats-core, nats-infrastructure, specialist-agent per their .guardkit/graphiti.yaml files). Each episode is prefixed [forge] … for project scoping within the shared group:

ADR-SP-014 (Jarvis Pattern A)
ADR-SP-015 (specialist dual-role)
ADR-SP-016 (singular topic convention)
ADR-SP-017 (stream retention)
TASK-REV-A1F2 outcome (verdict + full task-creation inventory + key findings)
Note: forge has no .guardkit/graphiti.yaml yet (only context-manifest.yaml). If you want forge-specific queries in future, add a graphiti config mirroring the nats-core/nats-infrastructure pattern with project_id: forge.

Review task closed
TASK-REV-A1F2 moved from tasks/backlog/ to tasks/completed/TASK-REV-A1F2/, status completed, decision implement, with full followup_tasks_created inventory in the frontmatter cross-referencing every task in every repo.

Suggested first move
TASK-FVD1 is the foundation — it's the only blocker for TASK-FVD2/3/4 and for all nats-core/specialist-agent work that depends on v2.2 decisions. Start there.


Loading context. Task is a complexity-7 architectural review anchored on forge-pipeline-architecture.md v2.1. The task spec is already extremely detailed, so I'll ask one focused scoping question before kicking off the review.

Phase 5 — Decision Checkpoint
Task: TASK-REV-A1F2 — Review and align Forge build plan docs with NATS, specialist-agent, and Jarvis repos
Mode: Architectural (comprehensive)
Report: docs/research/forge-build-plan-alignment-review.md

Verdict
⚠️ Ready to start Phase 1 (NATS infra validation) — but Phase 2 (nats-core), Phase 3 (specialist-agent), and all three forge build-plan docs must be corrected before any Forge code is written.

Headline findings
Anchor v2.1 is sound but silent on two things Rich has committed to verbally: Jarvis as human-facing trigger, and specialist-agent PO+Architect dual-role deployment. Two new subsections close both (§5.0 Build Request Sources, §3.1 Specialist Agent Deployment Model).
nats-core is NOT "✅ implemented" as forge-build-plan.md:38 claims. 98% covered on what's there, but BuildQueuedPayload, BuildPausedPayload, StageCompletePayload and 5 topics are missing. FeaturePlannedPayload is still exported and should be retired. Topic naming is agents.command (singular) in nats-core vs agents.commands (plural) in the anchor — recommend the anchor bend, not nats-core.
nats-infrastructure is READY today (streams, KV, FLEET/JARVIS/NOTIFICATIONS streams already provisioned, Docker Compose boots, zero PM-Adapter residue). But stream retentions don't match the anchor (PIPELINE 7d vs 30d, SYSTEM 1h vs 24h) — update the anchor to match installed reality. Also a pipeline-state KV bucket exists that conflicts with ADR-SP-013's "JetStream + SQLite only" model — decide.
specialist-agent dual-role is broken by one line: cli/main.py:2168 parses --role then calls hardcoded get_architect_agent_manifest(). Two concurrent deployments would collide on agent_id="architect-agent". Also the result payload doesn't wrap in the coach_score/criterion_breakdown/detection_findings shape Forge expects. Six corrections listed.
jarvis is docs-only (jarvis-vision.md + zero source code). But the design already uses exactly the CAN-bus / fleet.register / agent-registry KV plumbing that nats-infrastructure provisioned. Recommended integration: Pattern A — Jarvis publishes pipeline.build-queued.{feature_id} directly, Forge consumes the same topic regardless of source (CLI or Jarvis), Forge also registers on fleet.register for discoverability. This is a one-topic contract.
Both forge-build-plan.md and forge-pipeline-orchestrator-refresh.md pre-date v2.1 and still carry the old "Forge as checkpoint-manager receiving agents.command.forge" framing. They also set max_concurrent: 3 (contradicts ADR-SP-012) and expose a python -m forge.cli greenfield CLI surface that v2.1 replaced with forge queue.
Graphiti is empty — no nodes, facts, or episodes for any project concept. The graph has not been seeded. Wave 6 follow-up task addresses this.
Numbers
40 corrections catalogued, file-scoped, ordered by blocking severity
13 recommended follow-up tasks across 6 waves
4 repos audited comprehensively; 6 forge repo docs audited
0 stale PM Adapter / Kanban / RequireKit references found in forge repo or sibling repos (except FeaturePlannedPayload in nats-core)
Decision options
[A] Accept — Archive review, mark TASK-REV-A1F2 complete, seed Graphiti with key findings, proceed to create the Wave 1 doc-correction tasks manually.
[I] Implement — Auto-generate the follow-up task backlog from Section 7 of the report. This would create ~13 tasks across 6 waves under tasks/backlog/forge-build-plan-alignment/, each linked back to this review.
[R] Revise — Go deeper on a specific area. Candidates: (a) deeper spec of the BuildQueuedPayload field set with Jarvis multi-modal metadata, (b) full specialist-agent manifest refactor design, (c) ADR draft for anchor v2.2.
[C] Cancel — Discard findings.
Your choice?

forge-pipeline-architecture.md
[R] Revise — go deeper on all three suggestions a, b,c
Going deeper on all three. I'll append three appendices (C, D, E) to the alignment review with: (a) full BuildQueuedPayload design, (b) a surgical specialist-agent manifest refactor plan, and (c) four draft ADRs ready to paste into the anchor.


Phase 5 — Decision Checkpoint (v2, after revise)
Task: TASK-REV-A1F2
Report: docs/research/forge-build-plan-alignment-review.md

What was added in this revise pass
Three new appendices appended to the alignment report:

Appendix C — BuildQueuedPayload full design (~200 lines)

Complete Pydantic model with 15 fields, field-level validators, ConfigDict(extra="allow") for forward compat
Jarvis multi-modal metadata: triggered_by: Literal["cli","jarvis","forge-internal","notification-adapter"], originating_adapter: Literal[...] (terminal, voice-reachy, telegram, slack, dashboard, cli-wrapper), originating_user, correlation_id, parent_request_id
Two worked example payloads (CLI trigger + Jarvis voice trigger with config override)
Topic, stream, envelope, and consumer config spelled out
8 specific tests to add in nats-core
Correlation flow back to Jarvis (how correlation_id threads through BuildStarted/Progress/Complete so Jarvis can stream progress back to the originating adapter)
Appendix D — specialist-agent manifest refactor (~350 lines, surgical)

Current-state diagnosis with exact file:line references
Target-state architecture (role registry pattern + factory + Forge-shaped result wrapper)
Six independently-committable refactor steps, each with file paths, code skeletons, and tests:
Introduce roles/registry.py (zero behaviour change)
Refactor manifest.py into build_manifest_for_role(role_id, override) factory; keep legacy get_architect_agent_manifest() as a shim
Add _product_owner_manifest_factory and register with PO-specific intents/tools
CommandRouter.for_role(role_id) — role-aware dispatch
Wire --role in cli/main.py:2168
result_wrapper.py — wraps role output in {role_id, coach_score, criterion_breakdown, detection_findings, role_output} at the specialist-agent boundary
agent_id derivation rules: env var SPECIALIST_AGENT_ID > --agent-id flag > registry default
docker-compose.dual-role.yml fragment for the deployment
tests/integration/test_dual_role_deployment.py — the one e2e test that proves it works (registration, round-trip, cross-routing rejection)
Migration risk analysis (low; each step revertible; step 5 is the only breaking commit)
Appendix E — Four draft ADRs for anchor v2.2, in the existing ADR-SP-XXX format, each with Context/Decision/Consequences and ready to paste into §9:

ADR-SP-014 — Jarvis as Upstream Build Trigger (Pattern A). Includes the full option evaluation (A/B/C/D) and why Pattern A wins.
ADR-SP-015 — Specialist-Agent Dual-Role Deployment Model. Commits the {role_id}-agent naming, the env-var override, and the Forge-compatible result payload shape.
ADR-SP-016 — Singular Topic Convention (agents.command.*, agents.result.*). Anchor bends to nats-core reality; cheaper than rewriting 98%-covered code.
ADR-SP-017 — Stream Retention Reconciliation (PIPELINE 7d, SYSTEM 1h). Anchor bends to installed nats-infrastructure reality; SQLite remains the durable history store. Flags the pipeline-state KV bucket as a separate decision still needing its own ADR.
What changed in the numbers
Report length: 1,100 → 1,800+ lines
Recommended follow-up tasks: 13 (unchanged — the appendices deepen existing tasks, they don't add new ones)
ADRs drafted and ready to paste: 4
Decision options (unchanged)
[A] Accept — Archive review, mark TASK-REV-A1F2 complete, seed Graphiti with findings, proceed to create Wave 1 doc-correction tasks manually.
[I] Implement — Auto-generate the 13 follow-up tasks across 6 waves under tasks/backlog/forge-build-plan-alignment/.
[R] Revise further — Go deeper on any specific appendix or add a fourth deep-dive (candidates: specialist-agent result wrapper Pydantic model, Jarvis intent-router skeleton, a concrete v2.2 diff of forge-pipeline-architecture.md).
[C] Cancel — Discard findings.
Your choice?

[I] Implement — the tasks should be created in the relevant repo e.g., this one, specialist-agent, jarvis, nats-core and nats-infrastructure. The ADR's and any other Graphiti should be added using the correct project id
Going to implement. First I need to confirm the Graphiti project id and check task directory conventions in each sibling repo so tasks land in the right place and format.

Conventions understood. Forge needs its own graphiti config seeded (no .guardkit/graphiti.yaml exists). nats-core, nats-infrastructure use project_id: <repo> with shared groups including architecture_decisions. Jarvis has no task system — I'll bootstrap one. Now executing in batches.

Batch 1: Apply the 4 ADRs to the anchor doc as Proposed status.

All tasks created. Batch 6: Seed Graphiti with ADR episodes using correct project groups. I'll fire these in parallel — each scoped to its owning repo's project namespace via the episode name prefix, all into the architecture_decisions group which is the shared convention across sibling repos.

 =========================================================================
REVIEW COMPLETE: TASK-REV-D90D
=========================================================================

Architecture Score: 82/100
Findings: 8
Recommendations: 8

Key Results:
  Stale concepts (ready-for-dev, PM Adapter, kanban triggers): CLEAN
  NATS JetStream consistency: 8/10 (retired payloads in one table)
  Cross-document consistency: 9/10 (D38 title needs update)
  Implementation readiness: All primary docs ready for /system-arch

=========================================================================
Top 3 Findings (fix before /system-arch):

D38 title in fleet-master-index.md (line 645) — References retired feature_ready_for_build event as if current. Retitle to "Pipeline events replace kanban-triggered events" and update description to reference StageCompletePayload / BuildQueuedPayload.

Retired payloads in refresh doc (line 53) — FeaturePlannedPayload and FeatureReadyForBuildPayload listed as active payloads despite retirement decision at line 479. Annotate as retired.

Refresh doc pipeline event table (line 602) — Same retired payloads listed in comparison table. Update to exclude or annotate.

5 Lower-Priority Items:

PM Adapter phrasing in fleet-master-index line 142 (tighten wording)
nats-core coverage 97% vs 98% inconsistency across 15+ references
Stale task file TASK-update-build-plan-da15.md (target doc is superseded)
Completed task file TASK-update-fleet-index-d22.md (should be archived)
Alignment review outstanding items tracked in respective repos

2026-04-18 — TASK-FORGE-SCAFFOLD: Hand-scaffold orchestrator template files
=========================================================================

  Command:      /task-work tasks/backlog/project-scaffold/TASK-FORGE-SCAFFOLD-*.md
  Anchor commit: 5cf0da0c65479ad252f94ec288b040100eee4a3b
  Reference:    guardkit/.claude/reviews/TASK-REV-A925-review-report.md

  Rationale: guardkit-init is config-layer-only by design (TASK-INST-010,
  re-affirmed TASK-REV-A5F8). The pattern layer under each template's
  templates/ tree is build-time context for AutoBuild's Player, not
  init-time scaffolding. This task manually rendered the four (+1 bonus)
  files the Forge needs to unblock /system-arch.

  Source templates:
    ~/.agentecflow/templates/langchain-deepagents-orchestrator/
      templates/other/other/

  Files rendered:
    pyproject.toml.template         -> pyproject.toml
    AGENTS.md.template              -> AGENTS.md
    agent.py.template               -> src/forge/agent.py
    langgraph.json.template         -> langgraph.json
    orchestrator-config.yaml.template -> orchestrator-config.yaml
    (plus src/forge/__init__.py as new package marker)

  Placeholder substitutions (Forge values):
    {{ProjectName}}     -> forge  (langgraph.json)
    name field          -> forge  (pyproject.toml; literal in template)
    description         -> Pipeline orchestrator and checkpoint manager
                           for the Software Factory
    authors             -> Richard Woollcott <rich@appmilla.com>

  Additional changes to pyproject.toml (not in template, required to make
  an editable install work from the src-layout under the Forge package
  name):
    [build-system] setuptools>=68, wheel, setuptools.build_meta
    [tool.setuptools.packages.find] where=["src"]

  Post-LES1 hardening preserved verbatim from source templates:
    LCL-004  [providers] extras (langchain-openai, langchain-google-genai)
             with langchain-anthropic in base deps per CLAUDE.md rationale
    LCL-005  R2A1 ainvoke contract section in AGENTS.md
    LCL-006  env-var factory resolution (AGENT_MODELS__*_MODEL, env > yaml
             > hardcoded default precedence, empty string = unset)
    LCL-007  referenced in AGENTS.md (Evaluator zero-tools assertion path)

  Acceptance verification:
    [x] pyproject.toml has [providers] extras
    [x] AGENTS.md has R2A1 "Framework Contract: ainvoke()" section
    [x] src/forge/agent.py is syntactically valid Python (ast.parse OK)
    [x] langgraph.json exists, points to ./src/forge/agent.py:agent
    [x] No {{Placeholder}} strings remain across rendered files
    [x] `pip install -e ".[providers]"` succeeded (editable install,
        forge-0.1.0, all providers satisfied)
    [x] `python -c "import forge"` succeeded
    [x] .guardkit/context-manifest.yaml untouched (mtime Apr 13 unchanged)
    [x] Anchor commit created (5cf0da0)
    [x] command_history.md entry recorded (this block)

  Scope boundary: rendered files only, no business logic. Pipeline
  state machine, NATS integration, checkpoint protocol remain owned by
  FEAT-FORGE-001..008 via /feature-plan per forge-build-plan.md.

  Follow-ups unblocked (pending hard prerequisites in forge-build-plan.md):
    1. nats-infrastructure running on GB10
    2. nats-core integration tests passing (v2.2 payloads)
    3. specialist-agent Phase 3 (architect role NATS-callable)
    Then: /system-arch --context ... (Step 1 of build plan)
=========================================================================
All primary docs are now clean and ready for /system-arch context use.
